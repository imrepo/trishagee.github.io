      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since publishing &lt;a href=&#34;/post/blind_cfps&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great comments, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write yet
another post to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me state that I don&amp;rsquo;t think blind CFPs are a complete waste of time - for example, I know that there are
circles in which speakers will refuse to submit if the selection process isn&amp;rsquo;t blind. But what blind CFPs are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;,
is an answer to &amp;ldquo;How do I get more women speakers at my conference?&amp;rdquo;, especially if the problem is not that the
women are being rejected, but that they simply aren&amp;rsquo;t submitting talks - this is the situation I see most frequently
in the conferences I speak at/help organise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re missing the point of blind CFPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to address the point &amp;ldquo;Blind CFPs are to protect the organisers, not simply to improve diversity&amp;rdquo;. OK, great. So
in the case of the conferences that had only two women out of 200 submissions: if you make that process blind, whether you
select both women or not, when there are nasty comments about your lack of women speakers, you&amp;rsquo;re protected - you did
the right things, you had a blind CFP, and just not many women made it through that process. Women simply aren&amp;rsquo;t
writing compelling abstracts and/or aren&amp;rsquo;t picking interesting subjects and/or clearly aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in
presenting at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAAARRRGGHHHHHH!!!! Anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protect your arse if you like, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, I see the attacks against organisers and I understand the need to be able to
say you did the right thing. But notice that once you&amp;rsquo;ve protected yourselves, the blame is back on the
minorities for not meeting your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a blind CFP is to protect the selectors, then let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend it&amp;rsquo;s an answer to increasing diversity
of speakers, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece in a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;An abstract is not a representation of your talk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can emphasise this enough: blind CFPs have a very big weakness - there is no direct correlation between
a good abstract and a good talk. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a bunch of talks online lately, and I watched one with an abstract
that absolutely called to me - here was the missing piece for a technology that I simply can&amp;rsquo;t get my head around. I
gave an hour of my life to that talk, each minute I was wondering when this person would get to the bits mentioned
in the abstract, so I watched it all the way to the end. They never delivered what the abstract promised, and their
meandering style meant I learnt almost nothing from the talk. That&amp;rsquo;s an hour of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back. Good
thing I was playing computer games as well at the time, if I&amp;rsquo;d paid money for that I would have been very peeved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another weakness in this process - if you go to a number of conferences (like I do) you kinda learn which
speakers are doing
which talks.  If I submit my &amp;ldquo;AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong??&amp;rdquo;
talk to a blind process, if there&amp;rsquo;s anyone on the selection committee who&amp;rsquo;s even vaguely involved in the Java or MongoDB
spaces, they&amp;rsquo;ll know that&amp;rsquo;s me. And they can Google the talk and decide whether they like it (or with any luck, the
buzz-word crammed title will do the job and they&amp;rsquo;ll say yes, although probably AngularJS is so 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abstract is like your presentation in the same way that your CV is like your ability to do your job - there&amp;rsquo;s a skill
to writing good abstracts (or CVs), but mastery of that skill does not necessarily mean mastery of the thing it
represents - the ability to present or the ability to do the job.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be sold on a blind process
being a good way to build &amp;ldquo;the best content available for the conference&amp;rdquo; until this disconnect is somehow solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;For goodness sake Trisha, the postscript is nearly longer than the original post&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to feedback from a bunch of people, and I have learnt more things (thanks everyone!). I am more sold on
a blind CFP being maybe part of a bigger process. But I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe it fixes the &amp;ldquo;we need more women speakers&amp;rdquo;
problem, which was the original claim that I wanted to dispute. Conferences have to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more active to address
this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am not sold on an abstract being a fair representation of the quality of a talk. Maybe a more realistic &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo;
audition would be to give the talk to an audience, like a user group, who rated the talk:
the organisers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t watch the talk, but they could use the ratings to decide. Yes, the user group could also
have biases that affect their rating, but when the speaker gives the talk at the conference, those attendees will also
have their biases too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blindness is not a realistic option, we just have to keep putting women (and other non-white-straight-men) in front of
audiences until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Blind CFPs Really The Answer?</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Off the back of &lt;a href=&#34;/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I received a number of comments and questions
around blind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/&#34;&gt;CFPs&lt;/a&gt; (Call For Papers - usually to get into a conference you submit to a CFP) for
conferences. I often hear it said that a blind CFP will fix, or at least improve, the diversity imbalance at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I should caveat this with: this is going to be a blog post based on my experiences and chats with people, and I
have zero science to back this up. Sorry. But I do have some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of London conferences that I won&amp;rsquo;t name (because I haven&amp;rsquo;t asked their permission not because they&amp;rsquo;ve
done anything wrong) that in some years have received only 2 from around 200 (or more) submissions from women. These
conferences have accepted 100% of the submissions from women, and then been open to criticism for not having enough women
speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blind CFP to remove unconscious bias from the selection committee might have resulted in zero women speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know the next argument is that advertising a blind CFP might encourage a wider diversity of speakers to apply. This
does seem to work in some parts of the industry (I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to women from tech scenes that don&amp;rsquo;t intersect with mine
and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see that we have different problems in different segments of the wider development world). But for my
world, which is largely Java, with some forays into Agile, NoSQL, Open Source, and Enterprise, the women I speak to
aren&amp;rsquo;t scared they&amp;rsquo;ll be discriminated against if they put their name on a CFP. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to
lose by submitting and being rejected. They&amp;rsquo;re more afraid they&amp;rsquo;ll be accepted, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll have to give a
presentation! No, the women I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to in my world don&amp;rsquo;t submit because they don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready, they don&amp;rsquo;t think they
have anything to talk about, and they&amp;rsquo;re worried about the sorts of questions they&amp;rsquo;ll get asked when they&amp;rsquo;re standing up
there. Those fears aren&amp;rsquo;t allayed by having a blind CFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any fears of being judged as a woman, it&amp;rsquo;s when we&amp;rsquo;re standing up in front of people at the conference, and
no amount of blindness during the CFP process is going to make us feel better about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, I find the idea of a blind CFP terrifying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, if you have such a problem with judging people based on race or gender that you have to anonymise the
selection process, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to speak at your conference where my gender will be blatantly on show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, when I was starting out as a speaker, I was new to writing titles and abstracts and expected that they would
not be good enough to get in. With a blind CFP I would never find out why as I could never ask for feedback on my
anonymous abstract. As a novice speaker, I expected my gender would help me be selected, not hinder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, as an experienced speaker I know my abstract-writing has not really improved, but I know my presenting has,
and I know there are videos of me out there doing a good job as a presenter, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is my audition tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was starting out as a speaker, I knew there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough women presenters around. And although I hate the idea
of positive discrimination and hate the idea that men might think I got into my position merely because I&amp;rsquo;m female, I knew
that being a woman made me stand out in all those submissions. And I knew that enough conferences would take a chance on
me, if only to improve their diversity, and that&amp;rsquo;s all I needed to bootstrap my speaking career - once I had spoken at
enough conferences, once I had videos of me doing that, I would find it much easier to get into the next conferences.
And that&amp;rsquo;s worked. And now, as an experienced (female) speaker, I fear blind CFPs as they won&amp;rsquo;t know who I am or what I&amp;rsquo;m
capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my opinion as a female speaker. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to be on the programme committee for a couple
of conferences, and after three years or so of speaking at conferences I know a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of conference organisers.  Let&amp;rsquo;s
assume you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;merely&amp;rdquo; trying to build the best conference you can around your subject whilst not discriminating against
anyone (i.e. let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;re not going out of your way to actively promote diversity). How can you do this when you only
have abstracts and titles to go on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nber.org/papers/w5903&#34;&gt;studies around blind auditions for orchestras&lt;/a&gt;. And I understand
how tempting it is to try to apply that to our world, since it has had an effect on the number of women in orchestras
(but let&amp;rsquo;s not get too excited here, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about an increase from 5% to 25% over thirty years&amp;hellip;). I think
blind auditions would work really well for coding - we can look at just the code, without knowing anything about the
physical body behind the code, and figure out if that person is good enough for us. We could even do blind pair
programming, using screen sharing and chat (actually that&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll patent that!). Because
the thing you&amp;rsquo;ve anonymised (the code) is the output you really care about in a programming job. If you communicate via
chat you can even measure someone&amp;rsquo;s communication skills without judging them physically, another vital skill for
being part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a talk abstract is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the output we&amp;rsquo;re looking for.  Sure, a good title and abstract will attract attendees to the
conference and bums on seats in the actual talk. But the output you&amp;rsquo;re looking for is the presenter - their style, their
approach to the topic, their ability to hold attention, their ability to impart information. We&amp;rsquo;re not always looking
for the same things either, an interesting topic presented nervously but logically is fine, as is an entertaining
presenter reminding us of fundamentals we already know (and any other combination of strengths and weaknesses). An abstract
can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how good the presentation is going to be. Evaluating a presentation on a blind abstract would be like
evaluating those musicians on a couple of paragraphs explaining what they&amp;rsquo;re going to play and how they&amp;rsquo;re going to
try to make you feel when they play it - the words could sound great, but the musician might not even be able to play
the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best audition you can have as a presenter is to, well, present. Videos, audio clips, even screencasts. But the
problem with presenting is that it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking obvious that you&amp;rsquo;re a woman (or other variation on
non-white-straight-male).  If you can&amp;rsquo;t objectively evaluate a presentation without taking away the presenter&amp;rsquo;s
physical body (for colour
or gender or whatever), then you&amp;rsquo;ve got real problems. Your audience is going to be faced with that physical body for an
hour of their life, and you can bet they&amp;rsquo;ll be judging them too.  You want to be damned sure that you&amp;rsquo;ve selected a
competent presenter, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stand by that choice. Saying &amp;ldquo;oh, well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem boring in their
abstract&amp;rdquo; is not going to make the audience feel like you did a good job of the selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another point about non-blind selection processes, other than the process allowing you to select on presentation
ability rather than abstract-writing ability: you can be more active in promoting diversity. I am against &amp;ldquo;affirmative
action&amp;rdquo;, but if the proportion of women submitting presentations is lower than the proportion of women in the field, there&amp;rsquo;s
something missing.  Here are some of the things you can do if you identify a lack of a certain demographic - as usual,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rdquo;, but you could equally argue this for any demographic, even not-enough-C#-developers or
too-many-startups-not-enough-enterprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to relevant user groups and communities asking them to submit.  In London for example, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/&#34;&gt;Ladies Who Code&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-london/&#34;&gt;Women Who Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://london.girlgeekdinners.com/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Dinners&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/&#34;&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-London/&#34;&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data/&#34;&gt;Women in Data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekgirlmeetup.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/WIGJMeetup/&#34;&gt;Women in Games Jobs&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://girlsintechuk.com/community/&#34;&gt;Girls in Tech&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Geek-Girls-Unite-London/&#34;&gt;Girl Geeks Unite&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://witi.meetup.com/cities/gb/17/london/&#34;&gt;whole host of women techies meetups&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; And don&amp;rsquo;t think I psychically
know about all those
because I have two X chromosomes, I found half of those just now, in less than two minutes, by Googling
&amp;ldquo;Girl Geeks London&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women Tech London&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the faces of the women you do want to have speak (or the women on your programme committee, or both) on your
website - showing these women sends the message that this conference is for women. It should also impact the diversity
of your attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to specific women speakers and ask them to present. &lt;a href=&#34;/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about this before&lt;/a&gt;,
women speakers are few and far between, and a) they get
booked in advance and b) are busy enough not to have to (or want to) submit via a CFP process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;more ideas here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more - you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to drain the pool dry of known competent speakers-who-tick-some-diversity-box. With
a non-blind process you can actively improve the submissions you do have, assuming you&amp;rsquo;re not one of the conferences
suffering from a complete lack of submissions from those people. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to increase the number of women
presenting at your conference, if you have women submitting but they don&amp;rsquo;t quite meet your criteria (maybe the abstract
is weak, the title isn&amp;rsquo;t catchy, or maybe the presenter simply isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet) you, as the conference organiser, are
in the perfect position to mentor these people: you can help them re-write their abstracts; you can offer them mentoring
and training for presenting. If there&amp;rsquo;s no record of them presenting but you&amp;rsquo;re interested in evaluating their ability,
you can set them up with a user group to present at - as a conference organiser, you have the network contacts that
new speakers might not. You can run sessions aimed at people who have never done public speaking (I&amp;rsquo;ve run a session
like this four times now, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; and at Ladies Who Code -
I had &lt;em&gt;over 70&lt;/em&gt; RSVPs for the last London Ladies Who Code session, twice the number of the last LJC session,
so there are plenty of women interested in breaking into this field, who are looking for training, who don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready
to present yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are my points?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blind process of selection can be applied to something where the output you&amp;rsquo;re selecting for can be effectively
anonymised: music auditions, code, technical writing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blind process where you select based on criteria that are not the end result will only be effective
if it&amp;rsquo;s the selection process is biased, or if submissions to the selection process are lower
from discriminated-against-groups because they fear a biased selection process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those conferences that are getting very tiny numbers of submissions from women (I&amp;rsquo;m picking women as the example
but you can pick any group you want), a blind process could lead to even fewer selected women speakers. Instead of
switching to a blind process, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to want to check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the messaging around your conference (remember masculine words like rock star, ninja, competitive, hardcore,
challenging etc &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/31438/&#34;&gt;put women off applying to jobs&lt;/a&gt;, the same probably applies to technical conferences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subliminal messages on your website/info (one of the conferences I mentioned, for example, sent out a couple of emails
containing photos of previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences which happened to only show men - this was not even representative of
the conference, but it can have an unexpectedly big effect on the subconscious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have you showcased the diversity of the conference, or previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences, with photos, interviews, testamonials?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A non-blind submission process allows you to be more active in promoting diversity - instead of hoping that the
submissions are representative of the diversity in your community, and that selecting the most interesting talks
will naturally lead to improved diversity, with a non-blind process you can track exactly how many women are submitting,
address problems in this area early and offer mentoring to those who aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet. Remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified/0-qualified/&#34;&gt;women
only apply for jobs they feel 100% qualified for&lt;/a&gt;
and take fewer chances, they might need that extra push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that implementing a blind CFP will address the lack of diversity in conference speakers. I
know it helps in some circles, but I personally think that conference selection committees should a) be much better at
identifying their own biases and actively attempting to overcome them b) be active in improving the diversity of
their conference, and c) be offering feedback and mentoring to those who are not quite ready yet in order to improve
the overall ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity isn&amp;rsquo;t going to accidentally happen when we stop looking at gender and race and other visible you-don&amp;rsquo;t-belong-here
cues.  Diversity is only going to happen if people fight for it, and if we actively train, mentor, and support those
trying to break through the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/post/blind_cfps_2&#34;&gt;follow up&lt;/a&gt; based off responses to this post, covering additional questions raised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m so tired of it all</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We work so hard to promote equality, to fight for the rights of people who are not middle-class
white men, and time and again it just feels like we&amp;rsquo;re not getting anywhere.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internationalwomensday.com/&#34;&gt;International Women&amp;rsquo;s
Day&lt;/a&gt; highlights the issues that face women all around the world, and make our
women-in-tech problem
look like a genuine &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstworldproblems&#34;&gt;First World Problem&lt;/a&gt;, and yet we can&amp;rsquo;t even get that right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave up. This weekend I thought, fuck it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done my bit. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the phase in my
career where being a woman was a disadvantage and somehow arrived out the other side - in my position, in my job, it&amp;rsquo;s
an advantage, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to change anything to improve things for my career. I&amp;rsquo;m going to carry on doing my job to the best
of my ability, but I&amp;rsquo;m no longer going to let this diversity thing drain my energy - nothing ever seems to make a difference anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, four (white, middle-class, English-speaking) men who I know well, who
I have seen by their actions are champions of women in technology, who have personally mentored
me in some way or another, have been accused of not thinking about women techies, not encouraging them - have
been accused of sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This third year of being on the programme committee for QCon, I could see we had achieved far more to promote diversity
than ever before, but it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much work to get that far, and there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another conference I have great affection for which has never previously suffered badly from a lack of women speakers
received practically
zero submissions for full conference talks from women this year. The submissions that did come in were from the usual
suspects, the speakers who one calls upon when desperately trying to shore up the gender diversity of your speaker line-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sevilla Java User Group, which I started, with my money, which I present at regularly, has had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; female
developers attend who were not previously friends. Apparently the impact of visible female role models is far smaller than
I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so much work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s thankless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the men who support the women, they get attacked by both sides - by women, for not
doing enough, or sometimes for simply being privileged white men, by men and women for fighting for something that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact them, and by men for betraying their gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the women, it&amp;rsquo;s the same but more so: some women accuse us of not doing enough, some women sneer at what we&amp;rsquo;re doing,
telling us we already have equality, men and women think you&amp;rsquo;re in it just to improve your own life, and the men, well,
many men genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t understand the problems (and it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting to explain), and some are outright hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to find men allies.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone else, but at this stage in my career I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by men
who are all allies. And I can honestly say that any professional struggles I&amp;rsquo;ve had in recent years I can see are suffered
by my colleagues of the opposite sex, so I know they&amp;rsquo;re not because of my gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s only fair that our male allies suffer the same way we do, even though they get even less out of fighting our battles
than we do. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s fair that they are attacked by both genders, and have to put up with unfair, unjust
criticism and accusations. After all, look at some of the vile, hate-filled messages thrown at women leading the charge -
that&amp;rsquo;s abuse. Some of these women fear for their lives.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live that life, and I despair that we live in a
society that can&amp;rsquo;t seem to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m a bit burnt out. So my friends are finding it tough. But this is a marathon, not a sprint.  And I never did this
for me anyway. I care about diversity because it matters. I try to change the gender balance specifically, because that&amp;rsquo;s an area I
might be able to impact, one I have a chance of understanding. I care about equality, about justice, because
it matters. And I do my tiny part to try and drown out the hate, the anger, the &amp;ldquo;get back into the kitchen, woman&amp;rdquo;
because those things make me feel sick, because &amp;ldquo;you can be whoever you want to be&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a lie, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come
with caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or energy for large-scale revolutions, but I will carry on trying to make a small difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By trying to be a role model for anyone who can relate to me, whatever their colour, gender, or sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By being visible as a woman techie, who does woman techie things, who&amp;rsquo;s also a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By calling out (quietly and personally, at least at first) where I see things that might give the wrong message: e.g.
e-mailing conference organisers to point out they only have white men in their line up; private messaging people to
let them know their comments could be taken the wrong way; pointing out to user group leaders that their meetup
page shows only men at their events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By continuing to give an honest view of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a female Java developer, especially if these
experiences are different to those of other women - one woman&amp;rsquo;s view does not represent every woman&amp;rsquo;s view, if more
of us tell our different tales, we have a better view of the whole ecosystem (and its inhabitants).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By sharing not only the negatives, but the many positives of working in such a varied and rapidly changing profession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of fighting, however tiny my efforts are. But I&amp;rsquo;m more tired of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content and resources for my new Java 8 in Anger presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently this page contains the slides for the version presented at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/presentation/java-8-anger&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;, and the resources I used to create
the talk. This page will be updated with more resources (e.g. videos) as and when they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_10&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java 9 is just around the corner, and yet many of us developers have yet to use Java 8 features in an application. The
goal of this presentation is to move beyond slide-sized examples of streams and lambdas, and to show how to build a
fully working end-to-end application using as few external dependencies as possible, and the latest version of Java.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this session, Trisha will build a Java 8 application live. This application will consume a real-time feed of high
velocity data, contain services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard. Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll
encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections, and bump into the new date and time API.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The State of Java</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_state_of_java_update/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I think living in a beautiful city in a fantastic climate has its advantages.  Not just the obvious ones, but we
find people unusually keen to come and visit us on the pretence of presenting at the Sevilla Java User Group (and please,
DO come and present at our JUG, we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; visitors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we were really lucky, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro giving us
an update on where Java is now and where it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to use Java 8 in real life, so this could not have been better timed - I got to ask the guys a bunch
of questions about the intentions behind some of the Java 8 features, and the current vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My notes from the session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&#34;&gt;Lambdas&lt;/a&gt; could be just a syntax change,
but they could be more than that - they could impact the language, the libraries
and the JVM. They could have a positive impact on performance, and this work can continue to go on through small
updates to Java that don&amp;rsquo;t impact the syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; are a pipeline of operations, made possible/easier/more readable by lambdas. The aim is to make operations
on collections easier and more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Old World Order, you had to care about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to perform certain operations. With streams, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to
tell the computer exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s done, you can simply say what operations you want performed. This makes it easier
for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streams will take all the operations you pass in and perform them in a single pass of the data, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have
to write multiple loops to perform multiple operations on the same data structure, or tie your brain in knots figuring
out how to do it in one loop. There are also no intermediate data structures when you use streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation
can be optimised under the covers (e.g. not performing the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; operation if the data is already ordered correctly),
and the developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it. Java can introduce further optimisations in later releases without
changing the API or impacting the code a developer has already written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These new features in Java have a focus on readability, since code is much more often read than written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operations are easier to parallelise, because the developer is no longer dictating the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; - multiple &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops
might not be easy to parallelise, but a series of operations can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html&#34;&gt;Default methods&lt;/a&gt; and
new support for &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html#static&#34;&gt;static methods on interfaces&lt;/a&gt; are interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten you could put static methods on interfaces and I&amp;rsquo;m going to sneak them into my latest project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html&#34;&gt;Nashorn&lt;/a&gt; is here to replace Rhino. Personally I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in the sort of environment that would need server-side
JavaScript so this whole area has passed me by somewhat, but seems it might be interesting for Node.js or creating
a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&#34;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt;
in JavaScript that you want to run on the JVM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java_8_s_new_type&#34;&gt;additional annotation support in Java 8&lt;/a&gt;
will be useful for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;Java EE&lt;/a&gt;.  As this is something I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing
with (specifically web sockets) I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this, but it seems like it will be a while before this filters into
the Java EE that&amp;rsquo;s used on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html&#34;&gt;Mission Control and Flight Recorder&lt;/a&gt; - look interesting.  Feel like I should play with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are skipping straight from Java 6 to 8 - the new language features and improved performance are major driving
factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml&#34;&gt;End of public updates of Java 7 in April&lt;/a&gt;. Having libraries that, um&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; adoption of the latest version of
Java makes life a lot easier for those who develop the Java language, as they can concentrate on moving the language
forward and not be tied down supporting old versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaDB&lt;/a&gt;,
or my memory has completely discarded it. I had no idea what it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9&lt;/a&gt; is well under way, check out the JEPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(This is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1&#34;&gt;JEP process&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/&#34;&gt;Jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; was explained, and actually I could see myself using it for the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now. I had a look
to see if I could use it via the OpenJDK, but it looks like the groundwork is there, but not the actual modules themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/g1-intro-jsp-135488.html&#34;&gt;G1 Garbage Collector&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the go forward GC&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s the one that&amp;rsquo;s being actively worked on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193&#34;&gt;Enhanced Volatiles&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m so behind the times!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to internal packages is going away in Java 9. So
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t use any &lt;code&gt;sun.*&lt;/code&gt; packages&lt;/a&gt;.
Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.dzone.com/articles/jdeps-jdk-8-command-line&#34;&gt;jdeps&lt;/a&gt; to identify any
dependencies in your code that need to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and, looking further ahead than Java 9, we have &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169&#34;&gt;value types&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/&#34;&gt;Project Valhalla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/&#34;&gt;REPL for Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;possibly a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/198&#34;&gt;lightweight JSON API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~psandoz/varhandles/jvmls14-varHandles.pdf&#34;&gt;VarHandles&lt;/a&gt; were also mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the guys mentioned a &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/2y5Pv4yN0b0&#34;&gt;talk by Brian Goetz called &amp;ldquo;Stewardship: the Sobering Parts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which has gone onto my
to-watch list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became clear throughout the talk there are plenty of ideas that we could explore in later presentations.  If you want to see
any of the following, add a comment or ping me or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; on twitter or Meetup and we&amp;rsquo;ll try and schedule it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you can present on any of these topics and want to come to a beautiful, sunny city with amazing food to
do so, drop me a line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JCP, the purpose, the processes, the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a JSR, Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Date/Time (JSR310)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code optimisation vs Data optimisation (I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what this means, but I wrote it down in my notes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java EE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370772/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449370772&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=GGWNXKE672H3G2FY&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&amp;rsquo;s Lambdas and Streams&lt;/a&gt; book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617291994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1617291994&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=KDGWBWOK2S6FVS6F&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Action&lt;/a&gt; has details on other Java 8 features like Date and Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321927761/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321927761&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=7VJH32FI5ZVEDOMW&#34;&gt;Java 8 for the Really Impatient&lt;/a&gt; covers JavaFX too, and highlights some Java 7 features you might like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Goetz did a great talk last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLksirK9nnE&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lambdas in Java: A peek under the hood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I had to watch it twice before even half of the info sank in, but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Colebourne, the guy behind Joda time and the new Date and Time API, has &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/87157763&#34;&gt;this talk about the new API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9 OpenJDK page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Workshop: AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/resources/angular_java_groovy_mongodb_workshop/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/resources/angular_java_groovy_mongodb_workshop/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Setup required for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/tutorial/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together&#34;&gt;AngularJS/HTML5/Groovy/Java/MongoDB tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for QCon London 2015.
Sign up with code SPEAKGEE100 for £100 off the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Who is this for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop is aimed at Java developers who want to learn more about how
to rapidly prototype applications using web front-end technologies with JVM back-end technologies. The workshop may be
suitable for developers who don&amp;rsquo;t normally use Java as their primary language,
but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an introduction to Java and familiarity with server-side development of some kind is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript is expected, but previous experience of Groovy or MongoDB is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop is not suitable for people who have no programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on workshop, bring a laptop set up according to the following instructions - you will be writing code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/klw9pIuTICM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created my very first screencast! This video takes you through all the steps you need to go through in order to be
setup for the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup instructions below are the same process, so you can copy &amp;amp; paste where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you already have a version of the Java SDK downloaded. For this workshop, Java 7 or above should work, but
I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html&#34;&gt;download the latest version of Java 8&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re not already using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new work area for this tutorial. For the rest of these instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve put
 mine in &lt;code&gt;~/Projects/workshops/qcon2015&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Installing MongoDB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;MongoDB 3.0.0-rc8&lt;/a&gt;, but version 2.6 will be fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;Download MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system and unzip/install it.  Unless you prefer to put it
somewhere else, I suggest you unzip it to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/mongodb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have to create the directory for the data to go into. Create a &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so that you
have a folder at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the command line, start MongoDB to make sure everything is working.  From the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Windows:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;monogdb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
MongoDB should be running on localhost and port 27017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect to the shell to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;monogdb\bin\mongo.exe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You should see something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~\Projects\workshops\qcon2015&amp;gt;monogdb\bin\mongo.exe
MongoDB shell version: 2.8.0-rc5
connecting to: test
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.

Questions? Try the support group
        http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user
&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_8&#34;&gt;Creating your project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;the Cafelito project&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/cafelito&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a terminal/command line, navigate to this location, and run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_9&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./gradlew check
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_10&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gradlew.bat check
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This should download all the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open in your favourite IDE and import this directory as a new project. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 14&lt;/a&gt; and showing a number of its tricks. If you&amp;rsquo;re using IntelliJ IDEA and you
import this project as a Gradle project, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to do the above step, IntelliJ will download and import
the dependencies for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use Eclipse or
Netbeans (or whatever your favourite IDE is) but I&amp;rsquo;m out of practice using those IDEs and might not be able to help you out as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_11&#34;&gt;And now&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be ready to begin: you have a working instance of MongoDB, a skeleton project that we&amp;rsquo;ll be working with, and all the
dependencies should have been downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Part 2</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m all about Continuous Learning - after I wrote the
&lt;a href=&#34;post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij&#34;&gt;last post about IntelliJ Tips&lt;/a&gt;, I carried on through my trawl of the documentation
and, of course, discovered a load more things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know.  And this is all just in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Quick+Start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the next batch (although once again I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts
are for Windows unless otherwise stated, and Mac users should be able to replace the Ctrl key with Cmd in all these
cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Navigate between methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I knew you could use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-2.Structure&#34;&gt;structure thingie&lt;/a&gt;
(Ctrl+F12) to let you navigate to methods in your class (although I never actually
use it, it somehow never sticks in my head).  What I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-5.Navigatebetweenmethods&#34;&gt;jump between methods&lt;/a&gt;
using Alt+Up/Down arrows.  This strikes me as being super useful, especially to browse tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Refactoring String Fragments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted this feature so many times, but could never find it or get it to work - did you know you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-4.Stringfragments&#34;&gt;refactor out parts of a
hardcoded string&lt;/a&gt;
into variable/field/constant? Select the section of the String you want to extract, and use the normal &amp;ldquo;Extract&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
shortcuts - e.g. Ctrl+Alt+V to extract it into a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it and it does!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Invert Boolean&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a keyboard shortcut mapped by default, but using &amp;ldquo;Refactor -&amp;gt; Invert Boolean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (or using
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/index.html#toc_0&#34;&gt;our newly discovered&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; shortcut of Shift+Ctrl+A and typing &amp;ldquo;Invert&amp;rdquo;) you can tell IntelliJ you want
a boolean field to mean the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; thing, and it will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-6.Invertboolean&#34;&gt;flip the meaning everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.
For example, you might have an &lt;code&gt;saved&lt;/code&gt; flag, and you now want it to mean &lt;code&gt;notSaved&lt;/code&gt; - IntelliJ will make sure the
&lt;code&gt;isSaved&lt;/code&gt; method returns &lt;code&gt;!notSaved&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Magic Refactor Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t always know exactly what refactoring operation you want to perform, and IntelliJ is ready to help - it can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-10.Refactorthis&#34;&gt;suggest refactorings available in the current context&lt;/a&gt;
using the catchy magic incantation Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T.  Seems useful, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m not going to remember that
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Highlight implemented/overridden methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love everything about IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s ability to find usages of things - finding where methods are called, finding
implementations of a method, highlighting usages of a field, method or variable&amp;hellip; What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Find+Usages#FindUsages-6.Highlightimplementedandoverriddenmethods&#34;&gt;highlight the methods that implement or override a specific interface or superclass&lt;/a&gt;.
For some people, this might not add much, as your little &amp;ldquo;I override something&amp;rdquo; icon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/override.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; title=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;combined with the &lt;code&gt;@Override&lt;/code&gt; annotation, might tell you all you need to know. But that only really works if you&amp;rsquo;re implementing a
a single interface.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve correctly separated your concerns, you might implement several interfaces, and want to know
which are the methods from a particular one.  That&amp;rsquo;s where Shift+Ctrl+F7 on the &amp;ldquo;extends&amp;rdquo; keyword comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Run individual inspection by name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections&#34;&gt;inspections&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot.  They&amp;rsquo;re especially
useful if you have a codebase that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite conform to your ideal standards, so you can&amp;rsquo;t yet turn on automated
checks like checkstyle to break the build when the code doesn&amp;rsquo;t
conform - there&amp;rsquo;s an initial step where first you need to clean up the code.  Inspections are great, because you can
have IntelliJ give you little yellow marks to show where things are suboptimal, and aim to check in only files without
little yellow marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-6.Runasingleinspection&#34;&gt;run a single inspection&lt;/a&gt;
on files in any scope.  So if, for example, you wanted to
make sure that the code you&amp;rsquo;ve touched in this change has no unused bits, like
unused parameters or unused/untested methods, you could press Shift+Alt+Ctrl+I and type &amp;ldquo;unused&amp;rdquo;. Select the
&amp;ldquo;Unused Declaration&amp;rdquo; inspection and choose to run this on all uncommitted files.  This will tell you where you can
clean up your code, and every commit should make your codebase that little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Saving Power With Highlighting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know you could easily &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-7.Highlightinglevelandpowersavemode&#34;&gt;alter the active errors/warnings&lt;/a&gt;,
and use that to save power.  Quite Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;Auto indent your lines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost obsessively reformat my code as I go, pressing &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-1.Reformatcode&#34;&gt;Ctrl+Alt+L&lt;/a&gt;
almost like a muscle twitch. What I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered, though, is that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-2.Autoindentlines&#34;&gt;shortcut which will just fix the line
indentation&lt;/a&gt;,
which is probably 80% of what I need anyway - Ctrl+Alt+I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_8&#34;&gt;Fix Evil String Concatenation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this one earlier - do you know how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve gone around and manually changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.println(&amp;quot;This thing &amp;quot; + something + &amp;quot; is &amp;quot; + somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.printf(&amp;quot;This thing %s is %s%n&amp;quot;, something, somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you??? Anyway you don&amp;rsquo;t need to - Alt+Enter inside the params &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Intentions#Intentions-2.Stringconcatenation&#34;&gt;will suggest the replacement and do it for
you&lt;/a&gt;. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_9&#34;&gt;VCS Quick Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t use IntelliJ to the best of its abilities is the Git integration.  I&amp;rsquo;ve
been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/&#34;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; combined with IntelliJ to do most of my VCS management
(I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m just not a command line
person, I need to actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it). With the new laptop, I haven&amp;rsquo;t installed SourceTree yet and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and
do everything via the IDE.  Previously I used the right-click menu mostly for managing VCS operations, occasionally the
VCS menu, and did most stuff in the &amp;ldquo;Changes&amp;rdquo; window.  But now I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Alt+&amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; (Ctrl+V on the mac) to
bring up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Version+Control+Basics#VersionControlBasics-4.VCSoperationsquicklist&#34;&gt;menu of git-shaped operations for this
context&lt;/a&gt;.
To stop you having to hunt all over the keyboard to
find what on earth a &amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; is, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;#96;, which on both my UK and US (Windows) keyboards is in the top left
corner of your keyboard (on the Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s on the bottom left next to the shift, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need it since your
shortcut is different anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_10&#34;&gt;Amend Commits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered that you can commit a change which smushes up into your last commit and fixes it.  I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it commits the
new changes and (potentially) an updated commit message into the last change.  I really wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about this
earlier, on a number of occasions in the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve done this either manually or by doing a rather
dangerous soft reset.  I will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; be using this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/amend-commit.png&#34; alt=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; title=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_11&#34;&gt;The Cursor as a Breakpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Debugger#Debugger-5.Runtocursor&#34;&gt;use the cursor as a temporary breakpoint&lt;/a&gt;?
I did not.  Well, now you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_12&#34;&gt;Labelling Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by now none of us developers are doing that icky thing of having &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee/status/529299964787449856&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Copy of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Backup of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; filenames
and directories&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of our versions.  We&amp;rsquo;re all using a VCS of course.  But if you&amp;rsquo;re being strict about making
sure that every commit leads to a working build (we all do that, right&amp;hellip;?) then sometimes even distributed file systems
like git, with its local branches, are too heavyweight for experiments and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ has Local History, which I personally think you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rely on, but has occasionally saved my bacon in
times of strife.  It also does this really nice thing (automatically) where it labels versions where the tests passed,
so you&amp;rsquo;ve got some level of confidence that at that point in time, at that revision, things weren&amp;rsquo;t hideously broken.
At the very least, they must have compiled.  What I did not know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Local+History#LocalHistory-6.Putlabel&#34;&gt;add your own labels&lt;/a&gt;, so you could
label some local, non-committed version of the file as &amp;ldquo;feature x works but y doesn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; (or probably something much
shorter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it looks useful. As I say though, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a replacement for VCS, but a suppliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
So, that&amp;rsquo;s the end of Week One at JetBrains, and already I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole heap of things.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s more to
come, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Today</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Day three of my &lt;a href=&#34;/post/new_year_new_adventures&#34;&gt;brand new job&lt;/a&gt; - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&amp;rsquo;m
already a &amp;ldquo;Power User&amp;rdquo;, to see if there&amp;rsquo;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; read it.  Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&amp;rsquo;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what, today I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously known,
and they&amp;rsquo;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&amp;rsquo;t know was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s today&amp;rsquo;s list, and feel free to laugh at me and be smug in my direction if you already knew these things (note: I
have upgraded to IntelliJ 14, and at the time of writing I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of these features are new and which are
simply previously undiscovered):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Navigate directly to an action or option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Cmd+A (Mac) and start typing the name of the thing you want to do, or the setting
you want to change. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this especially useful now I&amp;rsquo;m back on Windows and I don&amp;rsquo;t have that nice helpful typing
box on the help menu that will take me straight to the menu item I want.  But what&amp;rsquo;s most useful about this for me today,
as I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a new profile on a new laptop (more on the new laptop later, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t defeat me utterly) is that
from here, you can turn various settings on and off without having to navigate through the settings screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/action.png&#34; alt=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; title=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Statement completion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew there was a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-4.Statementcompletion&#34;&gt;shortcut for finishing off a statement&lt;/a&gt;,
all that Java boilerplate you need to keep the compiler happy - semi colons and curly brackets and everything.  But
there is, and I can see it being super useful, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using other bits of IntelliJ code completion to
create the core of your line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Issue tracker integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure loads of people are already using integration with their favourite issue tracker, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought
about this as something that I really cared about.  But I was watching the intro videos for YouTrack (not surprisingly
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this instead of Jira during my time at JetBrains) and when I saw
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2_3Y1jLm5U&#34;&gt;how the IDE integration worked&lt;/a&gt;, I
suddenly realised how this small thing can add up to save thousands of keystrokes over time, not to mention saving
precious navigational seconds and window-switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, just the ability to generate at least the start of the commit message is a saving in time, and adds to project
consistency if all your developers are doing the same thing.  On my last project we only just realised we all quoted the
Jira issues in subtly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Settings shortcut keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I initially started using IntelliJ in anger back in 2008, I was very much a point-and-click type user. Over time,
pair programming with keyboard-super-users and giving live demos with very limited time available, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked harder
to become a keyboard-shortcuts person.  With the latest version of IntelliJ, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the tiny icons I use to get to
the settings window, something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot as I set up the new IDE instance on the new laptop.  So I bit
the bullet and learnt the keyboard shortcuts, and it&amp;rsquo;s already saving me a bunch of time (on the rare occasions when the
aforementioned &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; fails me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ctrl+Alt+S for the settings dialog (appears to be Cmd + , on the Mac)
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+S for the project structure dialog (appears to be Cmd + ; on the Mac)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; title=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t already using those either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Selecting the negative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use completion/suggestions all the time from IntelliJ, I&amp;rsquo;m far too lazy to type everything.  What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise, is
that you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to accept the default they give you.  If, for example, IntelliJ suggests a boolean value, you
can get it to negate that value by selecting it with &amp;ldquo;!&amp;rdquo; instead of enter or tab.  Yes, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve done a horrible job
of explaining that, but take a look at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-5.Negatingcompletion&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;
and try it, it&amp;rsquo;s quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Exclude from Autocomplete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of code completion, sometimes IntelliJ is sometimes just a bit too keen to suggest something, and you really
will never want that value.  In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used &lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Auto Import&lt;/code&gt; to manage the
suggestions (the most common one for me is I will never want &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;, I will almost always want
&lt;code&gt;java.util.List&lt;/code&gt;).  Well, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go into settings to do this, you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-9.Excludefromcompletion&#34;&gt;do it from the suggestions themselves&lt;/a&gt; -
navigate to the item you don&amp;rsquo;t want (in my case, &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;) and press Alt+Enter, this will give you the option
of excluding this from the suggestions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I found from just one day of browsing the documentation and setting up my IDE from scratch yet again.
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll promptly forget all these, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll be new weapons in my armoury of IDE-fu. Either way, maybe one or
two people will find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

about how developers aren&amp;rsquo;t just communing with the computer, they also need to feel listened to by real human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Year, New Adventures</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just over two years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;/post/and_for_my_next_trick/&#34;&gt;I embarked upon a journey&lt;/a&gt; as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then
called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB Inc&lt;/a&gt;). My goals for
this role were: to learn what it was
like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to
level up my advocacy skills.  I have met all these goals, and more - I met some fantastic people; learnt different approaches to
software development; discovered my new favourite database for creating applications; moved to Spain; started both a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;;
worked to understand the value of community and evangelism, and to help create a strategy for these areas;
and my evangelism efforts and open source work earned me the &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/website/java-champions/bios.html#Gee&#34;&gt;Java Champion&lt;/a&gt; title.
I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud of what I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved over this period, and very grateful to MongoDB for giving me these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, a new adventure is about to begin.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen my &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt;
this year, you&amp;rsquo;ll know of my love affair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;,
a tool I use daily (even for blogging). Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m joining the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;,
where I&amp;rsquo;m going Full Advocate. I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; this means I get to carry on doing more of what I love - presenting, writing,
and working on demos to help developers become more productive. I hope this will give me opportunities to stay ahead of the curve in the
Java/JVM world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, in answer to the Most Frequently Asked Question, I am staying in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Sevilla and I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to
leave yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/Sevilla.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; title=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall leave you with my somewhat disasterous &amp;ldquo;Top Ten IntelliJ Tips&amp;rdquo; from GOTO Aarhus, which is worth watching just to see Dan North
save me from the curse of the live demo.  Things can only get better from here, right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Speaker Diversity</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically,
although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem,
only identify some issues and explore some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&amp;rsquo;t post it now I&amp;rsquo;ll never post it, and it&amp;rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and
posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Firstly, what stops people from stepping up to speak?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the very first thing any developer says when you ask them why they haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about presenting at conferences or user
groups. Turns out, you always have something to say.  For example, our most popular sessions at the Sevilla JUG and MUG are &amp;ldquo;Introduction
 to&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;. You hear from plenty of experts who have travelled the whole road to some pinnacle of excellence,
 but what many developers need is simply someone a couple of steps ahead of them to lead them forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always know more than &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know everything, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know more than everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I be role model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So many women feel this, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely sympathetic to this view point: I&amp;rsquo;m a woman developer, getting along, happy in my job,
happy being a programmer, why the hell should I have to stand up and present and blog and be a role model for other women? Men don&amp;rsquo;t have
to do that. Men can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the fear that if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stand up, become a role model, that somehow people will think you&amp;rsquo;re representing all
women developers. You&amp;rsquo;ll be worried because you can only represent who you are, what you do, you can&amp;rsquo;t represent a whole gender in a
single presentation or a single interview.  And the pressure! What if I mess up? What if I say something my gender does not agree with?
What if I say something that causes my whole gender to be judged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally understandable fears. Totally true that many people will ask you to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; woman developer, to answer for all women.  Well,
that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking more women to stand up, to be role models - if we all step up, it will no longer just be me, and you,
and that other one over there. There&amp;rsquo;ll be more of us, more differing voices, we&amp;rsquo;ll stand out less. But we have to stand up first.  And
in the meantime it&amp;rsquo;s us and our points of view they&amp;rsquo;re listening to. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you rather voice your opinion than have someone else speak
on your behalf? Especially when very few people really can represent you, who you are and what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised at what you do know, so people who present run into this less than you&amp;rsquo;d think, even if you&amp;rsquo;re just beginning,
but just in case here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the question, paraphrasing. Firstly, this ensures you&amp;rsquo;ve actually heard the question correctly. Secondly,
it allows the whole audience to hear it, and thirdly, but most importantly, it buys you time to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest - say you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and move on. If you know somewhere that might have the answer,
point the person to that resource.  But a technical audience actually values the answer &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; more than you think. Especially
the person who asked the question, it makes them feel really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, but you think the audience might know, throw it back to them. Either to the person who asked the question,
if that feels appropriate (especially if this is one of those &amp;ldquo;look how smart I am&amp;rdquo; questions),
or to the audience as a whole. In conferences in particular, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance someone there knows the answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re genuinely terrified of all questions, say at the start of the presentation that you won&amp;rsquo;t take questions in the talk. Offer
an alternative, like via Twitter or e-mail, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;What can conference organisers do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically invite the people you want presenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t just wait for them to submit. If you want more women, more diversity, invite them. And invite them early&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your women presenters early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recognise that there are relatively few women presenters on &amp;ldquo;the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and understand that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants them to speak at their
conference. This rare breed, the female technical presenter, gets booked up &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; in advance.  They&amp;rsquo;re probably as in-demand as your
keynote speakers, and can probably devote less time to appearing at conferences than those who have made it to keynote-standard (I&amp;rsquo;m
making a sweeping generalisation that your techy women have day-jobs as developers and your keynote speakers are either professional
presenters or at least can argue presenting as a critical part of their job).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have a limited resource (experienced women presenters) that&amp;rsquo;s in high demand. You need to reach out directly to them,
invite them, and secure them well in advance of your conference.  Many big conferences, for example JavaOne and QCon,
will invite speakers six months in advance. If you give women speakers a month&amp;rsquo;s notice before your conference or event,
they simply are not going to have the space in their schedule at that late notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showcase your diversity on your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory&#34;&gt;microaggressions&lt;/a&gt;,
go and read what that means before you get any further.  There&amp;rsquo;s a very simple thing you
need to do with your website, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve opened for CFP or you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get attendees to register - make sure the photos on your
website show the type of diversity you want to encourage.  Only yesterday I was looking at the website of a big conference,
who I know for a fact are working &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to ensure diversity, not just with gender but race, age,
and where possible in less physically obvious dimensions. The conference is many months off, so the only photo they have on the website
is a background photo of the exhibition hall from some previous year, crammed full of attendees - white, male attendees,
as far as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to tell.  It&amp;rsquo;s extremely subtle. You might not even notice, as the photo is behind the headers and text of the
site. But I noticed. And you can be sure the subconscious of every person who went to the website to either submit a proposal for a
talk, or is considering asking their employer to pay for the registration, also noticed.  The conscious mind might be able to shrug it
off.  But the subconscious of a non-white and/or non-male person notices and plants the subtle seed
of &amp;ldquo;this conference is not for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, conference and event organisers - if you want more women applying to speak at your conference,
show more women on your website.  If you want a more diverse audience, show more diverse faces.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve invited your women presenters
early and secured them early, show their photos on the site - this sends a strong message to other women that their talk proposals will be
taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run warm up nights to try out new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know conference organisers get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of submissions, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which are going to be good speakers,
especially if they&amp;rsquo;re new speakers or don&amp;rsquo;t have a video.  If you&amp;rsquo;re genuine about improving the diversity of your speakers,
run free nights to a) promote your conference and b) try out new speakers.  Probably a good idea to have a new speaker and a known
speaker to attract the crowd and give newbies a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be so damn picky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New speakers need to be encouraged. Find a way to see their content without just discarding an unknown name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing speakers might not have the luxury of creating new content. Many conferences want genuine practitioners,
not just evangelists, but those people have day jobs and can&amp;rsquo;t be creating a new talk just for your conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave space for new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;and don&amp;rsquo;t just have 7 slots for a pro speaker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at your swag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not just guys t-shirts.  One conference gave out cupcakes for example. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just have to be handbags and high-heeled shoes,
just take a quick look and see if your swag is generally useful for techies, or if it leans towards men only. Men only swag (men&amp;rsquo;s
t-shirts, bottle openers, subtle things like that) subliminally says &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t belong here&amp;rdquo; to the women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t tell every individual why they were rejected, but you could look at all the rejected submissions and give broad indications of
the type of CFPs that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Maybe write a blog post explaining which sorts of talks didn&amp;rsquo;t make it and why.  This will help
speakers create content that better fits your conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be specific about what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have tracks you&amp;rsquo;re finding content for, put them on the website/CFP, so people know what the topics are. If you have an
idea that you want 30% beginner material and 30% very advanced, make that clear too. Especially if you want &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; beginner or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
advanced. People will submit more appropriate talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a beginner&amp;rsquo;s track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;not just for the speakers, for the content too. Beginner speakers may be more comfortable presenting &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; talks.&lt;br /&gt;
Having a beginners track, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for content or speakers, will make newbies feel more included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;What other things can we try?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User groups can grow talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice writing CFPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning talks, book club, different meetup styles (like fishbowl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run an open conference to encourage new speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s user groups are instrumental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So here&amp;rsquo;s something interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m sceptical of all-women user groups as I feel it separates us from the communities we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
contributing to. But women&amp;rsquo;s user groups can help us to integrate better.  For example, Duchess France helped and encouraged its members
to submit talks to Devoxx, gave feedback on CFPs before they were submitted, and provided a safe place for the women to practice
presenting beforehand.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing women&amp;rsquo;s user groups could be fantastic for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Advice for budding speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Do It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more you do it, the more comfortable you&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker, it can make you feel less of an impostor at a conference - you&amp;rsquo;re not just a woman developer, you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s afraid, it&amp;rsquo;s not just you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer wants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience is on your side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Small (user groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be technical. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be super smart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrapping is hard - you haven&amp;rsquo;t presented so you can&amp;rsquo;t get into conferences. Again, user groups can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair. Ask a more experienced presenter if you can co-present with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is perfectly acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate there is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more I could have covered, and many topics deserve more depth. But this is the brain dump from the Devoxx
session, and maybe one day things will be expanded into their own topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s not waste, it&#39;s learning</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/its_not_waste_its_learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/its_not_waste_its_learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one my my rare weekends at home, I found myself on a pottery course (this is the sort of thing that happens when you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; title=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time on the course, there was something enormously satisfactory and therapeutic about working with my hands,
on something creative that was for me, and only me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My first bowl&#34; title=&#34;My first bowl&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Honestly, I think the one I did in primary school when I was seven was better.&lt;br /&gt;
And I don&amp;rsquo;t care, because I loved creating it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really struck me that day was embracing failure and destruction as part of the creative process.  Let me give you a
couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher showed us several techniques for creating pottery, one of which was using plaster moulds and very liquid clay to produce more
complex items (for example, mugs and animal figures).  He told us that when using a new mould,
the first few items would be useless.  But these &amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo; are an important process for the mould itself.  The
class was in Spanish, so my understanding was imperfect, but I think it was something to do with the fact that the plaster moulds are
supposed to absorb water, and therefore I assume at the beginning they absorb far too much and the clay ends up being too dry and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; title=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;Pottery created with moulds&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example was when he showed us why it was so difficult to create a clay plate - bowls, mugs, cups were fine,
but a plate is difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s flat and the shape doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough structure for it to have any rigidity  if it&amp;rsquo;s even slightly damp
(and clay stays damp for a looong time, even in a climate like Seville&amp;rsquo;s). He demonstrated this by cutting straight through the plate
that he&amp;rsquo;d put into the mould earlier and folding it up, to the collective intake of breath of the whole class - a class of people of a range
of ages and backgrounds. We seem socially programmed to find destruction of any kind upsetting (which is probably, overall,
not a bad thing), when the teacher sliced the plate in half to demonstrate how floppy the plate was, we were all disturbed by this waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My pieces&#34; title=&#34;My pieces&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Even when I broke my bowl when preparing it for the kiln, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to abandon it - I turned it into a
candle holder&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing - it&amp;rsquo;s clay.  Clay is mud.  It&amp;rsquo;s from the ground.  Moreover, it&amp;rsquo;s almost completely reusable.  All of the leftover
clay from our earlier exercises, all of the excess liquid clay from the moulds, all of the pieces that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it,
it was put aside and saved for later.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a waste.  It&amp;rsquo;s learning.  It&amp;rsquo;s experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking.  If we can be like that about something concrete, something that exists in the real world,
why aren&amp;rsquo;t we like that about something as ephemeral as code?  Why are we so afraid to throw away code? And don&amp;rsquo;t tell me we&amp;rsquo;re not
afraid - how many &amp;ldquo;spikes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prototypes&amp;rdquo; have you seen running in production?  Have you read people talking about
creating code and throwing it away, and thought &amp;ldquo;that sounds nice, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to just producing useful code&amp;rdquo;? (Note: I&amp;rsquo;m not
talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&#34;&gt;throwing away perfectly good production code&lt;/a&gt;,
nor am I talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://codesqueeze.com/refactorbation/&#34;&gt;refactorbation&lt;/a&gt;, a term I just discovered and love.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating for research, spikes, learning etc, and then throwing it away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Java&#34; title=&#34;Java&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;What?? I needed to carve something into the medallion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477800670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1477800670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=5KXFITDLKQQCXD3K&#34;&gt;Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1477800670&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;,
and there&amp;rsquo;s a section in there that talks about getting into the habit of
creating just for the sake of creating.  Not for your side projects, not for a client, not even for your portfolio.  Simply to get into
the habit of creating.  &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; some of those ideas, or processes, will come in handy later down the line.  Or maybe,
like the clay moulds, simply creating something for throwing away actually helps the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiences have left me with a feeling that I should start getting used to the idea of throwing code away,
and start creating things for no reason other than the feeling of creating.  It could be like running - in theory I run so I have to
worry less about my weight and my fitness, but actually I run &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more frequently when I run just for the joy of running. The fitness
and health are side benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re so reluctant to throw code away precisely because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ephemeral.  Maybe with the clay,
we can see that concrete thing, that mud, being turned into something useful eventually.  With running,
you can feel the difference in your attitude, in your fitness, maybe see it on the scales. With code, when you delete those characters,
revert that change, you feel like you lost something, and have nothing to show for that precious time.  When actually you created new
pathways in your brain, added new memories and learnt new lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready yet to create just for the sake of creating, I think I&amp;rsquo;m just too results-driven. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to
write about it here to remind myself that it is something I want to do. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the exercise, not the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The full haul&#34; title=&#34;The full haul&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The final pieces, still needing the kiln to finish the glaze.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/presentation/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I gave a keynote at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to address the problems
of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not by putting it into production).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWKf3ROVgrY?list=PLEx5khR4g7PIIBNcNhHOMmOhzxcwI5joG&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41120693&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;355&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;During the talk I show an example of how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/a3e4a54329e94ada2fe2&#34;&gt;implement lambdas&lt;/a&gt;,
and I also demonstrate a very crude performance test for using &lt;code&gt;parallelStream&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to link to the performance test as it&amp;rsquo;s
not a shining example of how to write these sorts of tests, but if you&amp;rsquo;re desperate you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find it in my Github repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also talk about how amazing Spock is, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested you can read more about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/tags/spock/&#34;&gt;my experiences with Spock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was built off an &lt;a href=&#34;/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/&#34;&gt;earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, about how to decide which technologies to
invest your personal time in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this crude decision
chart and the mind-map of potential ways to play with a technology. Remember, learning to say &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; to a technology can be very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/staying-ahead/why-learn.png&#34; alt=&#34;Decision Flow Diagram&#34; title=&#34;Decision Flow Diagram&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/staying-ahead/approaches.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Approaches to trying new technologies&#34; title=&#34;Approaches to trying new technologies&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of writing a book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/careeradviceforprogrammers/&#34;&gt;Career Advice for Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re
interested, let me know (because, you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve got loads of spare time for another project, sigh&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Presentation Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all want to stay ahead of the curve - after all, that&amp;rsquo;s what you go to a conference for. But have you ever considered how being ahead
of the curve might be dangerous?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using a new language before you understand it, putting a technology into production so you can learn it,
abandoning &amp;ldquo;old practices&amp;rdquo; before you&amp;rsquo;ve got the benefit from them… These things are common practice,
under the guise of Progress and Keeping Up To Date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But while we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be running around like headless chickens chasing the next Shiny New Thing,
we do need to see to our Continuous Learning and, of course, we should Embrace Change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we balance these two extremes? And how do we see to our own growth and learning as techies while meeting the needs of our
project, team and organisation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MongoDB London</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/mongodb_london/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/mongodb_london/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt;, 6th November, 50% off with discount code &lt;strong&gt;50Trisha&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt; is nearly upon us again,
and I&amp;rsquo;m dead disappointed I can&amp;rsquo;t make it this year (I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;keynoting at GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; instead,
which I&amp;rsquo;m terrified, I mean, excited, about). The last MongoDB London was really interesting for me - I was fairly new to the company,
I&amp;rsquo;d been here less than six months, and it was a really great way to go both broad and deep on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to find a blog post where I talked about my experiences, but it looks like I only wrote that In My Mind. In fact,
I only only wrote two whole lines of notes on the conference.  But 18 months later I clearly remember presentations from my colleagues
&lt;a href=&#34;http://rosslawley.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://derickrethans.nl/&#34;&gt;Derick&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the geo capabilities in MongoDB,
presentations which heavily influenced the &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving
recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember Eliot&amp;rsquo;s presentation - Eliot is one of those people who totally gets away with breaking the &amp;ldquo;speak in a measured,
clear fashion&amp;rdquo; presenters rule, he fires fascinating information at you at high speed and it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the compelling things
about his talks. If you ever get a chance to see him talk about the product, it&amp;rsquo;s totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the most awesome thing about the conference was the chance to meet, and talk to,
a bunch of different MongoDB people - there are the engineers who work on the product (like me and my colleagues);
the people leading the way with the technology, like Eliot; and finally, but for me most importantly,
you get to meet really interesting people who are using MongoDB in ways that you might not even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway the point of this sales pitch is, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using MongoDB already or you&amp;rsquo;re keen to find out about it,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt; is only going to take a day from your life,
and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a bunch of interesting things. And, with a Special Discount Code from me,
it&amp;rsquo;s only £45! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mongodb-london-2014-registration-13140209721&#34;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;strong&gt;50Trisha&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
