      <title>What could possibly go wrong? (GOTO Chicago)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, I was given the chance to chat a bit about the presentation I was giving,
which happens to be the same one I&amp;rsquo;m giving at a number of conferences this year (although of course I&amp;rsquo;m evolving it as I go along).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation leaves very little time for anything other than coding, as it&amp;rsquo;s quite challenging to create a full app in 50
minutes, so it was great to have the chance to talk about the motivations for the demo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed video-player&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&#34;youtube-player&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/sZee7lRAUF4&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;The video of the actual talk is also available now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed video-player&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&#34;youtube-player&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/kmVnhyWqozA&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning it doesn&amp;rsquo;t clearly show the screen, but it does improve.  You can see an earlier version from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/demo-java-javascript-mongodb#anch110035&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt; as well,
so if something&amp;rsquo;s not clear on one of the videos, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s better in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito/tree/goto-chicago&#34;&gt;code for the Chicago version is on Github&lt;/a&gt;,
and if you look through the history you can see how it builds up, the same as it does in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>...but most of all, it&#39;s fun</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/most_of_all_its_fun.md</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/most_of_all_its_fun.md</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I loved this analogy: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@nkkl/ride-like-a-girl-1d5524e25d3a&#34;&gt;Cycling is awfully similar to being a woman&lt;/a&gt;.
It nicely describes how it feels to be marginalised and not quite &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;. But there are some things that I&amp;rsquo;d like to
add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a cyclist is an enormous advantage, especially in gridlocked cities like London and New York,
because your maneuverability makes up for your lack of speed, and means you can skip queues and get to the front,
if you are assertive enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the bike lanes are badly designed, I share the main roads with other users.  I&amp;rsquo;m a road user,
I play by the rules, and in most cities I&amp;rsquo;m travelling only marginally slower than the cars. Just because the road wasn&amp;rsquo;t built for you
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you don&amp;rsquo;t have every right to use it.  And just because they made a crappy effort to include you doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to
go their route if it&amp;rsquo;s going to slow you down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/bad-bike-lane.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Who put a tree there?&#34; title=&#34;Who put a tree there?&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a thrill from being a bit outside of Their rules and not conforming to Their expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes it&amp;rsquo;s fraught with danger, but it&amp;rsquo;s a game. And it&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated to read there have been
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate
.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/05/30/nyc_citi_bike_zero_fatalities_in_new_york_city_bike_share_program_s_first.html&#34;&gt;zero fatalities in New York&amp;rsquo;s Citi Bike scheme&lt;/a&gt;.  Contrary to
expectations, opening up the city to masses of (often novice) cyclists has made road users more aware of them,
and forced the city to create infrastructure for them. Can we port this back across our analogy to being a woman?  What if we opened up
the advantages of being a woman to people who aren&amp;rsquo;t hardcore pioneers going it alone?  How would we do that?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sevilla Java User Group Java 8 Launch Party</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_java8_launch_party</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_java8_launch_party</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night at the Sevilla JUG we officially celebrated the launch of &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/&#34;&gt;Java 8&lt;/a&gt; - yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bt48HX7IQAAQBQq.jpg:large&#34; alt=&#34;Partay&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the picture, people had more fun than it looks.  Honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who missed the session, or who was there and wants access to the materials, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/lambda-streams-java-8&#34;&gt;The Main Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/happy-mappy&#34;&gt;Trisha&amp;rsquo;s real-life lambda code&lt;/a&gt; (the class we were looking at was &lt;code&gt;TweetDecorator&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/SimonRitter/javase8-55thingsv2-sritter&#34;&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; of another of Simon&amp;rsquo;s
presentations, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtAredKhyac&#34;&gt;55 New Features in Java SE 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the last link is to a video from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/&#34;&gt;vJUG&lt;/a&gt;, the Virtual Java User Group,
which is a great source of presentations from international speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Readable, Succinct, or Just Plain Short?</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/short_vs_readable.md</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/short_vs_readable.md</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which is more readable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;releaseVersion = version.substring(0, version.indexOf(&#39;-SNAPSHOT&#39;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;releaseVersion = version[0..-10]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a value of &lt;code&gt;0.109-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;, they both give the same result.  And I&amp;rsquo;m tempted by the second,
because it&amp;rsquo;s shorter.  But I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with the first one - not because it&amp;rsquo;s more Java-ish and I&amp;rsquo;m scared of Groovy syntax,
but because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to understand if/when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: if &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t conform to the expected pattern, the two code fragments fail in two different ways.  If &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;
doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain &lt;code&gt;-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt;, the first will fail with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whereas the second will either arbitrarily slice the last 9 characters off the end of whatever the String does contain,
or if it&amp;rsquo;s too short you&amp;rsquo;ll get something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Negative array index [-10] too large for array size 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you, the developer, see this error (or notice your mangled version number) and look at the failing line of code,
you&amp;rsquo;ll have two different experiences.  When looking at the second example, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t write it in the first place or if you have a
memory as shocking as mine, you won&amp;rsquo;t get any clues from that code as to what the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; is - you&amp;rsquo;ll see what it does (chop the last
9 characters off the &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; string), but not why.  You can &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the problem by adding an arbitrary 9 characters onto your &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the first example, however, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the intent right there - it&amp;rsquo;s trying to chop the string &lt;code&gt;-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; (and any
characters that might happen to come after it) off the end of the &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; string.  With this line of code,
if you checked the value of &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; and saw it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the correct suffix, you&amp;rsquo;d have a good idea of what the problem is and how
to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a third way, that potentially keeps the descriptiveness (is that a word?) of the first solution and makes it a bit shorter and
Groovier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;releaseVersion = version[0..&amp;lt;version.indexOf(&#39;-SNAPSHOT&#39;)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need the less-than sign plonked in there to make it work correctly, which I find a bit jarring,
but it does work.  It&amp;rsquo;s a little more succinct than the original Java syntax and retains the intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion: yes, shorter code is generally better (and often more readable).  But I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in sacrificing code that
expresses the intent in order to reduce the number of characters used.  We&amp;rsquo;re not living in a memory-poor world any more,
and code is meant to be read by humans as well as computers.  Let&amp;rsquo;s make our code easy to understand when it goes wrong,
not simply the shortest way to do something when the stars are all perfectly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Handover</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/the_handover.md</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/the_handover.md</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I walked into the kitchen to see how lunch was going and my boyfriend handed me a knife,
a part-chopped hard boiled egg and said &amp;ldquo;finish this, I need to have a shower&amp;rdquo;. As you do. Apparently there were two things that needed
doing - &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; needed finishing, and I needed to keep an eye on the fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;paired&amp;rdquo; with him while we&amp;rsquo;ve made that salad before, and I can tell when a fish is burning.  How hard could it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finished chopping the egg and putting it into the salad, I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if that was the last thing that needed to go into
the salad - when he said &amp;ldquo;finish this&amp;rdquo;, did he mean the whole salad, or just the egg chopping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This blog post will be vaguely about technology at some point.  Probably.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching for other eggs that might need to be added, and sifting through the salad to see what was already in there,
I was still unclear about whether it was &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary/Definition-of-Done&#34;&gt;done&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; or not, so I
went to bother my boyfriend in the bathroom (this is not a euphemism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I told you there were only two things left to do&amp;rdquo; he said - it was so clear to him what the steps were to finish,
that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand that there might be hidden assumptions in his handover.  All he wanted was for me to finish chopping the
(only) egg.  Oh and mix it all up. Of course. When I checked if I was supposed to add the olive oil and the salt, the answer was &amp;ldquo;No,
I don&amp;rsquo;t trust you to do that&amp;rdquo; (he&amp;rsquo;s right - I&amp;rsquo;m English, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know you could put salt in a salad
and certainly have no idea about quantities of olive oil. My Spanish boyfriend is genetically wired to know this stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unclear instructions (&amp;ldquo;keep an eye on the fish&amp;rdquo;, if taken literally, could result in me watching it burn - fortunately I knew it
was secret code for &amp;ldquo;remove it from the heat when it&amp;rsquo;s done&amp;rdquo;) we had a very nice lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/HandoverSalad.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Salmon &amp;amp; Salad&#34; title=&#34;Salmon and Salad&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are parallels between this, and what I was struggling with last week (hurrah, we get to the tenuous analogy!).  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying
to do my first release for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia&#34;&gt;Morphia&lt;/a&gt;, the project I&amp;rsquo;m taking over
for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.  I know my colleague was working hard on an automated release script (one click releasing FTW),
and I know he invested a reasonable amount of time in automating the release process (this is code for &amp;ldquo;I had a bad feeling about this&amp;rdquo;).
I was going to be the first to try this out without his machine/settings/user. Yay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday night Justin gave me some tips of what was involved, finishing with &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;and then &lt;code&gt;.gradlew relase&lt;/code&gt; should just work&amp;rdquo;.  Simples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day One: I struggled with the nexus plugin and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day Two: I woke up with one of those ideas that hit you in the night and fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I spent two days trying to work out why the Git plugin wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realised that for the whole time I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been using the local version of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/evanchooly/github-release-gradle-plugin&#34;&gt;gradle release plugin&lt;/a&gt; like I thought,
but an older version. When I fixed that&amp;hellip; I spent half a day proving I still had the same issue as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I commented out the code that wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, hard coded a bunch of values and used an old script to upload the Javadoc (don&amp;rsquo;t
get me started on how long it took me to find how &lt;a href=&#34;http://maven.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; was populating the release number,
nor do I want to express the pain I felt at having to install Maven after being in love with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; for the
last two years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia/releases/tag/r0.108&#34;&gt;release 0.108 of Morphia&lt;/a&gt; went live on Thursday night - huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, as a responsible human being, rather than high-fiving myself, cracking open a bottle of wine and knocking off for the
weekend, next I need to prepare the handover for the next person doing the release. Not least because it&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be me,
and my memory is shocking.  I have two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a wiki page with the steps needed, manual or automated, including all the local properties that need to be set up as we can&amp;rsquo;t
have some of these passwords floating around on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the automated release so it really is one click / command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, option 2 still needs documentation because of the local properties that are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really want to do is crack open that wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the moral of the story is: handovers are hard.  And essential.  And worse, often the person doing the handing over is doing so
because they&amp;rsquo;re short on time and, for whatever reason, not responsible for the next phase of the project. Combine this lack of time with
all the assumptions and implicit knowledge in that person&amp;rsquo;s head, and the information being transferred is likely to be&amp;hellip; less than
optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the handover receiver is now responsible for something they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough knowledge of and they&amp;rsquo;re not even aware of assumptions or
unknown unknowns. If you&amp;rsquo;re handing over between departments or teams, they might not even have the right tools to find out how to
progress (Ops teams and testers don&amp;rsquo;t always have access to the code, for example, and if they did might not have the context to find it
useful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tools to help ease the pain of handovers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PairProgrammingMisconceptions.html&#34;&gt;Pairing&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing might seem expensive (two people at one
keyboard?? How will they type fast enough?), but the savings in handover time (and increase in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia
.org/wiki/Bus_factor&#34;&gt;Bus Factor&lt;/a&gt;) make it completely worthwhile.  Pairing with The Boy in making salad meant at least I knew what the steps and
ingredients were, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know what stage we were at. At LMAX, we reduced a lot of our testing backlog by embedding the testers
in the development team, and pairing with them at the start and at the end of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html&#34;&gt;user stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t do pairing, code reviews help. I was at least aware of our release plugin as I&amp;rsquo;d seen the original develop in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/&#34;&gt;Java
driver&lt;/a&gt;. If I&amp;rsquo;d been pairing or code reviewing on Morphia,
I would have been even more aware of what the steps were and what changes had been made for that project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, if good old fashioned talking isn&amp;rsquo;t your thing, documentation is a good start.  And everyone who uses the docs needs to be
able to update the documentation when they find something wrong, missing, confusing, or just want to annotate it with something useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these good practices, really what you want is to remove all possible areas of miscommunication. Computers are logical things,
 so if you can write down an exact list of steps that need to be done in order to achieve something,
you might be able to, I dunno, write that in a script, or something. If you
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321601912&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=M5DNVR42T66J63VO&#34;&gt;Automate All The Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have these messy,
complicated conversations with these messy, complicated people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to try and fix my script. I&amp;rsquo;ve even thought of a way to not need local properties, so maybe next time (or the time after),
when I have to do a release I&amp;rsquo;ll only have to type a single command. It&amp;rsquo;ll be worth a week or two to implement this if it saves me a week
like the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, that wine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;No boyfriends or colleagues were harmed in the making of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nighthacking at Sevilla Java User Group</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/nighthacking_jug_sevilla</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/nighthacking_jug_sevilla</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://steveonjava.com/&#34;&gt;Mr Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt; came to Sevilla on his crazy European tour to show us Lego and Robots.  This was our largest turnout yet
for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; event in Sevilla, which surprised me as it was on a weekend,
and the weekend before the spectacle that is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_Seville&#34;&gt;Semana
Santa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/I5rnDZGNJW8&#34;&gt;in Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the first event that we&amp;rsquo;ve had videoed (apologies for the horrible focus at times on the video,
I&amp;rsquo;m just learning and used to relying heavily on auto-focus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/q3OKs08X3oo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much to Stephen for visiting, and thank you to those who came, you&amp;rsquo;re making me re-think the idea of running events at
weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=21306622&#34;&gt;photos on Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What do you mean, Backwards Compatibility? (YOW 2013)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Career Advice for Programmers (YOW 2013)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example,
by &lt;a href=&#34;/post/how_to_make_your_cv_not_suck/&#34;&gt;creating CVs that don&amp;rsquo;t suck&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=&#34;/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/&#34;&gt;staying ahead of the curve&lt;/a&gt;),
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davethomas.net/&#34;&gt;Dave Thomas&lt;/a&gt; asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon
.com/video#36&#34;&gt;GOTO Aarhus&lt;/a&gt;, a talk I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short
time.  Dave seemed to like something in it though, as he gave me the opportunity to present the topic again at YOW last December,
and this time I think I managed to distill the important points into the (still ridiculously short) time allotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yow.eventer.com/yow-2013-1080/career-advice-for-programmers-by-trisha-gee-1380&#34;&gt;See the video here&lt;/a&gt;,
and please give me any feedback you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise there are many many more topics I could cover, so I&amp;rsquo;d better start making a list.  Suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upcoming Events 2014</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_events_2014</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I updated you on my travel plans, so now I&amp;rsquo;ve had some more conferences confirmed,
I thought I would pass the information on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really lucky to have been selected for some great conferences this year.  I was asked to do a few more,
and it was genuinely painful to say no to everything, but it seems the laws of space and time cannot be broken,
and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to select a tiny subset of all the places I&amp;rsquo;d like to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 May: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/presentation/HTML5,%20Angular.js,%20Groovy,%20Java,
%20MongoDB%20all%20together%20-%20what%20could%20possibly%20go%20wrong?&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;m giving the same live coding presentation from QCon London,
although knowing me I expect there will be some tweaks, changes, additions, and maybe improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22-23 May: In New York City, since I&amp;rsquo;m more or less in the area.  Gimme a shout if you want to meet for a drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25-28 May: &lt;a href=&#34;http://speakerconf.com/&#34;&gt;SpeakerConf&lt;/a&gt; Barcelona.  And while I&amp;rsquo;m in the area&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 May: Barcelona JUG - &amp;ldquo;HTML5, Angular.js, Groovy, Java, MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-5 June: New York City, probably (wait, am I going to be at home at all??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 July: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/35444&#34;&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; - live coding again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28 Sep - 2 Oct: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/speakers/index.html#gee&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; woohoo!  I love having this opportunity to visit San
Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of other events I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to work out the details for, but I think this is 2014 all booked up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/qcon_london_2014/&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;, I was grabbed for an interview with InfoQ.  It&amp;rsquo;s always a pleasure to be interviewed by Charles,
I think he brings out the best in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the video &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-mongdo-java8#.U00BRMNMIC4.blogger&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the interview we refer to the first time we met, which, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, &lt;a href=&#34;/post/interviewed_for_infoq_at_qcon_london/&#34;&gt;you can also watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting Blogger to Markdown</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/project/atom-to-hugo</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/project/atom-to-hugo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; happily for three years or so, since I migrated the blog from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; and
decided to actually invest some
time writing.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy with it because I just type stuff into Blogger and It Just Works.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy because I can use my Google
credentials to sign in.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy because now I can pretend my two &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+TrishaGee/&#34;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; accounts exist for a purpose,
by getting Blogger to automatically share my content there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things have been problematic for the whole time I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code looks like crap, no matter what you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pictures are awkwardly jammed in to the prose like a geek mingling at a Marketing event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to solve a number of ways, with custom CSS at a blog- and a post- level.  I was super happy when I
discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://gist.github.com&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;, it gave me lovely content highlighting without all the nasty CSS.  It&amp;rsquo;s still not ideal in a
blogger world though,
as the gist doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear in your WYSIWYG editor, leading you to all sorts of tricks to try not to accidentally delete it. Also I was
too lazy to migrate old code over, so now my blog is a mish-mash of code styles, particular where I changed global CSS mulitple times,
leaving old code in a big fat mess.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lesson to be learned there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem, photos, I just gave up on. I decided I would end up wasting too much time trying to make the thing look pretty,
and I&amp;rsquo;d never get around to posting anything.  So my photos are always dropped randomly into the blogs - it&amp;rsquo;s better than a whole wall of
prose (probably).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy overall, the main reason being I don&amp;rsquo;t have to maintain anything, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about my web server going
down, I don&amp;rsquo;t have versions of a blog platform to maintain, patch, upgrade; I can Just Write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last week &lt;a href=&#34;http://spf13.com&#34;&gt;my boss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://christiankvalheim.com/&#34;&gt;my colleague&lt;/a&gt;  were both on at me to try &lt;a href=&#34;http://spf13.com/project/hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;,
a site generator created by my boss.  I was resistent because I do not want to maintain my own blog platform,
but then Christian explained how I can write my posts in &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;, use Hugo to generate the content,
and then host it &lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. It sounded relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering a move to something that supports markdown for a while, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These days I write at least half of my posts on the plane, so I use TextEdit to write the content,
and later paste this into blogger and add formatting.  It would be better if I could write markdown to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve always disliked wiki-type syntax for documentation, markdown is actually not despicable,
and lets me add simple formatting easily without getting in my way or breaking my flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I spent a few days playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.spf13.com/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to see what it was, how it worked, and whether it was going to help me.  I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a
few observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hugo really is lightning fast&lt;/strong&gt;.  If I add a &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file in the appropriate place, and with the Hugo server running on my local machine
it will turn this into real HTML in (almost) less time than it takes for me to refresh the browser on the second monitor.  Edits to existing
 files appear almost instantly, so I can write a post and preview it really easily.  It beats the hell out of blogger&amp;rsquo;s Preview feature,
 which I always need to use if I&amp;rsquo;m doing anything other than posting simple prose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s awesome to type my blog in IntelliJ&lt;/strong&gt;.  Do you find yourself trying to use IntelliJ shortcuts in other editors?  The two I
miss the most when I&amp;rsquo;m not in IntelliJ are Cmd+Y to delete a line, and Ctrl+Shift+J to bring the next line up.  Writing markdown in
IntelliJ with my usual shortcuts (and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/nicoulaj/idea-markdown&#34;&gt;markdown plugin&lt;/a&gt;) is really easy and productive.
Plus, of course, you get IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s ability to paste from any item in the clipboard history. And I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about those
random intervals when blogger tells me it hasn&amp;rsquo;t saved my content, and I have no idea if I will just lose hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I now own my own content&lt;/strong&gt;.  It never really occurred to me before that all the effort I&amp;rsquo;ve put into three years of regular blogging is
&lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;, on some Google servers somewhere, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a copy of that material.  That&amp;rsquo;s dumb,
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect how seriously I take my writing.  Now I have that content here, on my laptop, and it&amp;rsquo;s also backed up in Github,
both as raw markdown and as generated HTML, and versioned.  Massive massive win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have more control over how things are rendered&lt;/strong&gt;, and I can customise the display much more.  This has drawbacks though too,
as it&amp;rsquo;s exactly this freedom-to-play that I worry will distract me from actual writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with every project that&amp;rsquo;s worth trying, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely without pain.  I followed the (surprisingly excellent) &lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.spf13.com/overview/introduction&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://j3ff.com/blog/building-a-site-with-hugo/&#34;&gt;these guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but I did run into some fiddly bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get my head around the difference between my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/trishagee.com&#34;&gt;Hugo project code&lt;/a&gt; and my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/trishagee.github.io&#34;&gt;actual site content&lt;/a&gt; to begin with: how to put them into
source control and how to get my site on github pages.  I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with two projects on github,
even though the generated code is technically a subtree of the Hugo project.  I think I&amp;rsquo;m happy with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure about the difference between tags, keywords, and topics, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest.  Maybe this is something I&amp;rsquo;ll grow into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really need to spend some time on the layout and design, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to simply rip off Steve&amp;rsquo;s original layout.  Plus there are
things I would like to have on the main page which are missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to convert my old content to the new format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final migration from old to new (incomplete)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the last point first, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet if I will take the plunge and do full redirection from Blogger to the new github pages
site (and redirect my domains too), for a while I&amp;rsquo;m going to run both in parallel and see how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the fourth point, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a tool for migrating Blogger blogs into markdown that didn&amp;rsquo;t require me to install some other tool
 or language, and there was nothing that was specifically Hugo-shaped, so I surprised myself and did what every programmer would - I
 wrote my own. Surprising because I&amp;rsquo;m not normally that sort of person - I like to use tools that other people have written,
 I like things that Just Work, I spend all my time coding for my job so I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to devote extra time to it.  But my recent
 experiences with &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy.codehaus.org/&#34;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; had convinced me that I could write a simple Groovy parser that would take my exported blog (in Atom XML
 format)
  and turn it into a series of markdown files.  And I was right, I could.  So I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new github project,
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/atom-to-hugo&#34;&gt;atom-to-hugo&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s very rough, but a) it works and b) it even has tests.  And documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s come over me lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a creative, coding machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the new way of working, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to take me a while to get used to it and decide if it&amp;rsquo;s the way
I want to go.  At the very least, I now have my Blogger content as something markdown-ish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are a couple of things I miss about Blogger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually like the way it shows the blog archive on the right hand side, split into months and years.  I use that to motivate me to
blog more if a month looks kinda empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Google Analytics is definitely more powerful than the simple blogger analytics, I find them an easier way to get a quick insight
into whether people are reading the blog, and which paths they take to find it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think either of these are showstoppers, I should be able to work around both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sevilla MUG March Madness</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_mug_march_madness</link>

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JVIgox7nGXo/UyjIQYxtiSI/AAAAAAAANc4/JV3lj4xwcgk/w919-h689-no/IMG_20140318_193758.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/events/166679892/&#34;&gt;Last night&lt;/a&gt; the Sevilla MUG had our
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lczajkowski.com/2014/02/19/march-madness-comes-to-a-city-near-you/&#34;&gt;March Madness&lt;/a&gt; event.  This was our largest event yet,
with 36 people signed up.  Although the aim of March Madness is to have a MongoDB Engineer at all the user groups this month,
that&amp;rsquo;s not such a big deal for us as I live here, so this was also the first event where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the main attraction - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JvrBaena&#34;&gt;Javier&lt;/a&gt; gave a really great talk about the lessons learnt at &lt;a href=&#34;http://es.socialbro.com/&#34;&gt;SocialBro&lt;/a&gt; after using
MongoDB in production for the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides for my introduction to Replica Sets and Sharding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
 &lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/32480708&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 And the slides for the main attraction:

&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
 &lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/32464459&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px; font-size:small&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare
 .net/fjavierbaena/sevilla-mongo-developers-group-mongodb-cmo-aprendimos-que-la-culpa-era-nuestra&#34; title=&#34;Sevilla Mongo Developers Group
 - MongoDB: Cómo aprendimos que la culpa era nuestra&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cómo aprendimos que la culpa era nuestra&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/strong&gt;from&lt;strong&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/fjavierbaena&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Francisco Javier Baena Ríos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event went really well, everyone seemed engaged, and our first talk in Spanish seemed to encourage more questions than normal.  We
were also in a new venue, and although I love the central location of our previous venue and the friendliness of the owners,
the menu of the new location seemed to be a massive win.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. My 4th QCon London.&amp;nbsp; That’s not bad.&amp;nbsp; And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/qcon-day-one.html&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, and even 2007 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-initial-thoughts.html&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-todo-list-inspired-by-conference.html&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; - how cute was I? &amp;ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&amp;rdquo;)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?) minute and do a live coding session, something much more technical than my recent talks.&amp;nbsp; I’ll leave the details for a separate blog post though, when the video comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that stands out for me from Wednesday though was Damian Conway programming &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_Game_of_Life&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; in Klingon.&amp;nbsp; Yeah.&amp;nbsp; Just find the video and watch it, the man is a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12947751623/player/f7e8167be5&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The Thursday keynote was inspiring too from a totally different point of view - Tim Lister of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY5A8X2/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00DY5A8X2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Peopleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00DY5A8X2&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; fame shared stories from his career, and I came away from that really happy I work as a technologist, but with an increased desire to learn off other amazing people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12966704755/player/7193594b96&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;On Thursday I hosted the&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/sets/72157641948363514/with/12970259753/&#34;&gt;Not Only Java&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;nbsp;track - I’m on the programme committee for QCon, and this year we wanted to cover&amp;nbsp;leading edge technologies (as always) but we didn’t want to slice things into strict technology silos [interruption: argh! the person in front of me nearly destroyed my laptop by suddenly moving their chair back! Why do people bother in economy on a morning flight?]. &amp;nbsp;So I wanted the Java track to be more representative of what today’s Java programmers care about - for the programmers of course, but also because I know there are architects and team leads at QCon who might not realise how things have moved on with the language, and how much polyglot programming we do these days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com.es/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; kicked it off with a great history lesson on the progress (or occasionally,&amp;nbsp; lack of it) in Java.&amp;nbsp; He begged us to study and understand Set Theory, to use async design, to think of the users of our APIs, and, most of all, to design nice, clean code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Next up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EvaAndreasson&#34;&gt;Eva&lt;/a&gt; took us through the fundamentals of Garbage Collection - this might not seem like a cutting edge subject these days, but it’s one of the most misunderstood subjects for Java programmers.&amp;nbsp; Eva gave us a really great, understandable view of the different types of garbage collectors, how they work, and their pros and cons.&amp;nbsp; She left us with a call to arms to not simply let other people try and solve this problem, but to get stuck in and contribute ourselves, via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/&#34;&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12970531704/player/e2c2f63b43&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch was my nerve-wracking live coding session, putting together a full stack end-to-end web app using AngularJS, HTML5, Java and MongoDB.&amp;nbsp; It only went wrong twice, and people seemed to like it.&amp;nbsp; I’ll post the video in another blog post as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s publicly available. &amp;nbsp;Code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;available on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;We’ve been playing with the open spaces idea at QCon.&amp;nbsp; The Java one only had a few people in it, but that gave everyone a chance to speak at least.&amp;nbsp; We covered Java 8 (the Good and the Bad); other JVM languages; and UIs for Java (Javascript or GWT?).&amp;nbsp; And I plugged the work the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; does in London, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;After this &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodil.org/&#34;&gt;Bodil&lt;/a&gt; blew me away creating a My Little Pony game using &lt;a href=&#34;https://rx.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;RX&lt;/a&gt; in the browser.&amp;nbsp; ‘Nuff said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/speakjava&#34;&gt;Simon Ritter&lt;/a&gt; gave us a view of the Java 8&amp;nbsp; features most likely to impact the way Java developers think about software design - lambdas and streams.&amp;nbsp; I thought this was a really great introduction to the concepts if you haven’t seen them before, and with concrete examples that showed how we should be using them. &amp;nbsp;If you&amp;rsquo;re not already looking at lambdas and streams, you should be - even if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be using Java 8 yet, it&amp;rsquo;s worth getting a heads up on how it&amp;rsquo;s going to impact our programming style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’m very pleased with the way the Java track turned out on the day - every speaker was first class, a wide range of topics was covered, and I, for one, learnt something in every presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;To finish off the day, Emma Langman gave an awesome keynote about how people are the messy bit of your system, and how they’re never rational and you shouldn’t expect them to be.&amp;nbsp; I also highly recommend this talk, especially if you’re a techy and you’ve found yourself in some sort of management or team lead position.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Sadly I couldn’t stay for day three of the conference, I had to fly off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/the-joy-of-coding.html&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt; to re-give the live coding presentation there.&amp;nbsp; Because, if you’re going to do something terrifying and doomed to failure, you might as well do it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QCon is an expensive conference, especially compared to the developer-friendly prices of something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.co.uk/&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;, but for getting a big picture of where the industry is, of things you might be missing, for learning hard core technical skills and understanding the important of the fluffy-people-stuff, and finally for meeting a wide range of people from developers to CTOs, I think you&amp;rsquo;d be hard pushed to find something better in London. &amp;nbsp;IMHO (and remember, I did disclose I&amp;rsquo;m on the programme committee). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although it&amp;rsquo;s really hard work putting together the programme for a track like this, and although both times I&amp;rsquo;ve said I&amp;rsquo;m Never Doing It Again, when it goes this well it makes you want to do it all over again. &amp;nbsp;After a break. &amp;nbsp;A looong break.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/sparking_innovation_in_an_established_company</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’ve been running into &lt;a href=&#34;https://corporate.sky.com/&#34;&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt; a bunch this week - firstly I was invited to kick off their innovation tech talks series last Monday, then I kept meeting Sky people (that makes it sound like they’re aliens) at &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It seems Sky is keen to create/foster a culture of innovation, which is an ambitious goal for such a large company.&amp;nbsp; So I was given a very vague brief for Monday’s presentation (“Can you do something Mongo-ish, maybe a bit of performance and concurrency stuff, and talk about overall best practice?”) I gave them an early view of a presentation I’m working on titled something like “Why do we keep reinventing the wheel?” (anyone who saw me at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jfokus.se/&#34;&gt;JFokus&lt;/a&gt; might realise that I cunningly swapped out most of the body of the “What do you mean, backwards compatibility?” talk and tried out this topic instead).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4a4pY12N7xM/Ux2KVRwNLpI/AAAAAAAANRw/gVsUg08fwyU/s1600/TrishaSky.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4a4pY12N7xM/Ux2KVRwNLpI/AAAAAAAANRw/gVsUg08fwyU/s1600/TrishaSky.jpg&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: right;&#34;&gt;Picture courtesy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&#34;g-profile&#34; href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/111755189375322301397&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;+Russell Miles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was supposed to be a 20 minute intro talk (OK, so I clocked it at 40 minutes in rehearsal) with the rest of the time devoted to questions on any subject I know about, or even anything I have an opinion on.&amp;nbsp; Sounds dangerous, but means I can always move fast on the answers I don’t know in order to cover more ground - cunning, you see?&amp;nbsp; Actually, that sounds like it would be more fun if alcohol were involved.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Anyway.&amp;nbsp; The talk bit of the session took up most of the time, because I had really good questions during the course of the presentation.&amp;nbsp; It’s nice to talk to a much smaller group (there were maybe 30ish people, giving up their free time after work, like an internal user group).&amp;nbsp; But I also had questions on remote working, on creating a culture that’s appealing for developers to come and work in, and on MongoDB.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I don’t know how many companies do things like this, or lunchtime brown bags, or something, but I think they’re a great idea.&amp;nbsp; This was a mix of people from different departments, different teams, working on different technologies.&amp;nbsp; It was a good way to get people from across the organisation talking with each other and sharing best practice between teams.&amp;nbsp; Many organisations have people working in their little silo, and we (MongoDB) often find ourselves introducing teams from within the same organisation to each other - there’s no other mechanism for one team to find out about the other.&amp;nbsp; I guess that’s what white-tower architects were supposed to be for - to know what everyone’s up to and make sure people are doing the “right” thing.&amp;nbsp; Given this doesn’t seem to work, what else can we do to share knowledge internally?&amp;nbsp; How else can we get the right people to meet each other?&lt;/div&gt;
