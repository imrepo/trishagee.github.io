      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the list in the &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/public_appearances/&#34;&gt;talks section&lt;/a&gt; of my blog covers past presentations,
this page should, if I keep it up to date, list my confirmed upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Mar&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.be/&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;m running a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/tutorial/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together&#34;&gt;half day tutorial&lt;/a&gt; based on
&lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;the AngularJS/Java/MongoDB live demo&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up if you want to
code along as I build a mobile-friendly web-app, and you can use the discount code SPEAKGEE100 for £100 off the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Mar&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/&#34;&gt;Ladies Who Code, London&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ll be running my Public Speaking for Novices
Clinic for the ladies who code.  Join me if you&amp;rsquo;re even slightly curious about improving your presentation skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Mar&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt; - New Live Demo! &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/presentation/java-8-anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/a&gt;,
featuring streams, lambdas, JavaFX and other Java-shaped things.  What Could Possibly Go Wrong (again)? (You can use the
code SPEAKGEE100 for £100 off the registration price for QCon.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 Mar&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-techmakers-istanbul-15-tickets-15606349010&#34;&gt;Women Techmakers Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; -
Building a webapp with AngularJS, Java and MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8-10 Apr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.fr/&#34;&gt;Devoxx France, Paris&lt;/a&gt; - Java 8 in Anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-11 Apr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://greachconf.com/&#34;&gt;Greach, Madrid&lt;/a&gt; - New talk! Is Groovy Better than Java for Testing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22-24 Apr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://craft-conf.com/2015&#34;&gt;Craft Conf, Budapest&lt;/a&gt; -
&lt;a href=&#34;http://craft-conf.com/2015/#speakers/TrishaGee&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/a&gt; again, so this had better go well at QCon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29-30 Apr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springio.net/&#34;&gt;Spring I/O, Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springio.net/sessions/&#34;&gt;Is Groovy Better than Java for Testing?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 May&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2015&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt; - an agile-centric version of my new Groovy vs. Java testing
talk, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2015/presentation/Level%20Up%20Your%20Automated%20Tests&#34;&gt;Level Up Your Automated Tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted a bunch of other CFPs, and I have some other invitations in-flight, only the confirmed sessions are
on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content and Resources for my new &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/presentation/java-8-anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect this page to evolve over time as this talk evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the talk has only just been created, the only resources available are the code and the articles and videos I used
to create the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Project code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code demoed is available on the &amp;ldquo;steps&amp;rdquo; branch of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/sense/tree/steps&#34;&gt;sense repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The State of Java</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/svq_state_of_java_update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I think living in a beautiful city in a fantastic climate has its advantages.  Not just the obvious ones, but we
find people unusually keen to come and visit us on the pretence of presenting at the Sevilla Java User Group (and please,
DO come and present at our JUG, we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; visitors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we were really lucky, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro giving us
an update on where Java is now and where it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to use Java 8 in real life, so this could not have been better timed - I got to ask the guys a bunch
of questions about the intentions behind some of the Java 8 features, and the current vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/44036521&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;355&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/trishagee/2015-java-update-and-roadmap-jug-sevilla&#34; title=&#34;2015 Java update and roadmap, JUG sevilla&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2015 Java update and roadmap, JUG sevilla&lt;/a&gt; from Georges Saab and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My notes from the session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&#34;&gt;Lambdas&lt;/a&gt; could be just a syntax change,
but they could be more than that - they could impact the language, the libraries
and the JVM. They could have a positive impact on performance, and this work can continue to go on through small
updates to Java that don&amp;rsquo;t impact the syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; are a pipeline of operations, made possible/easier/more readable by lambdas. The aim is to make operations
on collections easier and more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Old World Order, you had to care about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to perform certain operations. With streams, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to
tell the computer exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s done, you can simply say what operations you want performed. This makes it easier
for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streams will take all the operations you pass in and perform them in a single pass of the data, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have
to write multiple loops to perform multiple operations on the same data structure, or tie your brain in knots figuring
out how to do it in one loop. There are also no intermediate data structures when you use streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation
can be optimised under the covers (e.g. not performing the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; operation if the data is already ordered correctly),
and the developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it. Java can introduce further optimisations in later releases without
changing the API or impacting the code a developer has already written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These new features in Java have a focus on readability, since code is much more often read than written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operations are easier to parallelise, because the developer is no longer dictating the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; - multiple &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops
might not be easy to parallelise, but a series of operations can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html&#34;&gt;Default methods&lt;/a&gt; and
new support for &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html#static&#34;&gt;static methods on interfaces&lt;/a&gt; are interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten you could put static methods on interfaces and I&amp;rsquo;m going to sneak them into my latest project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html&#34;&gt;Nashorn&lt;/a&gt; is here to replace Rhino. Personally I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in the sort of environment that would need server-side
JavaScript so this whole area has passed me by somewhat, but seems it might be interesting for Node.js or creating
a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&#34;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt;
in JavaScript that you want to run on the JVM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java_8_s_new_type&#34;&gt;additional annotation support in Java 8&lt;/a&gt;
will be useful for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;Java EE&lt;/a&gt;.  As this is something I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing
with (specifically web sockets) I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this, but it seems like it will be a while before this filters into
the Java EE that&amp;rsquo;s used on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html&#34;&gt;Mission Control and Flight Recorder&lt;/a&gt; - look interesting.  Feel like I should play with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are skipping straight from Java 6 to 8 - the new language features and improved performance are major driving
factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml&#34;&gt;End of public updates of Java 7 in April&lt;/a&gt;. Having libraries that, um&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; adoption of the latest version of
Java makes life a lot easier for those who develop the Java language, as they can concentrate on moving the language
forward and not be tied down supporting old versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaDB&lt;/a&gt;,
or my memory has completely discarded it. I had no idea what it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9&lt;/a&gt; is well under way, check out the JEPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(This is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1&#34;&gt;JEP process&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/&#34;&gt;Jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; was explained, and actually I could see myself using it for the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now. I had a look
to see if I could use it via the OpenJDK, but it looks like the groundwork is there, but not the actual modules themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/g1-intro-jsp-135488.html&#34;&gt;G1 Garbage Collector&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the go forward GC&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s the one that&amp;rsquo;s being actively worked on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193&#34;&gt;Enhanced Volatiles&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m so behind the times!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to internal packages is going away in Java 9. So
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t use any &lt;code&gt;sun.*&lt;/code&gt; packages&lt;/a&gt;.
Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.dzone.com/articles/jdeps-jdk-8-command-line&#34;&gt;jdeps&lt;/a&gt; to identify any
dependencies in your code that need to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and, looking further ahead than Java 9, we have &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169&#34;&gt;value types&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/&#34;&gt;Project Valhalla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/&#34;&gt;REPL for Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;possibly a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/198&#34;&gt;lightweight JSON API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~psandoz/varhandles/jvmls14-varHandles.pdf&#34;&gt;VarHandles&lt;/a&gt; were also mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the guys mentioned a &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/2y5Pv4yN0b0&#34;&gt;talk by Brian Goetz called &amp;ldquo;Stewardship: the Sobering Parts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which has gone onto my
to-watch list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became clear throughout the talk there are plenty of ideas that we could explore in later presentations.  If you want to see
any of the following, add a comment or ping me or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; on twitter or Meetup and we&amp;rsquo;ll try and schedule it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you can present on any of these topics and want to come to a beautiful, sunny city with amazing food to
do so, drop me a line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JCP, the purpose, the processes, the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a JSR, Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Date/Time (JSR310)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code optimisation vs Data optimisation (I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what this means, but I wrote it down in my notes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java EE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370772/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449370772&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=GGWNXKE672H3G2FY&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&amp;rsquo;s Lambdas and Streams&lt;/a&gt; book&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brian Goetz did a great talk last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLksirK9nnE&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lambdas in Java: A peek under the hood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I had to watch it twice before even half of the info sank in, but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Colebourne, the guy behind Joda time and the new Date and Time API, has &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/87157763&#34;&gt;this talk about the new API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Switching to the Surface Pro</title>

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, leaving MongoDB also meant leaving my MacBook air (I should have thought this job more through more carefully).
so I had a tough decision to make - get a new MacBook, or try something else (or reclaim my personal MacBook off my
boyfriend,
but that option conveniently slipped my mind, as who wants to upgrade to a 4 year old piece of hardware?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very very happy with the MacBook air - in fact, I bought my personal one after ThoughtWorks foisted one onto me for my short tenure
there, and I became addicted to the way it felt for typing, to the easy of using the touchpad (and never feeling like I needed
an external mouse), and, most of all, I loved that it was only marginally heavier than a large bottle of water. I could never go
back to another portable computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until someone at the London Java Community unconference showed me their Microsoft Surface. At first, I sneered - its windows, amd although
I actually rather liked the Nokia Lumia I was given for being anRemarkable Woman, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sold  on New World
Windows. But then, I saw how thin and light it was, and how nice the screen was.  And the keyboard was detachable,
and its a tablet. and a laptop. And it has a proper Windows Desktop mode, for installing Real applications, its not just a Very Expensive
iPad competitor.  And then? The guy who owned the surface whipped out his stylus, and started drawing pn tje screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; im interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device has the capability to solve a problem ive been having, and have been trying to address a number of ways: I carry too much stuff around when
I travel. and I travel a lot.
  - I bring my laptop, so I csn code while im away, and for presenting from - I can present from the iPad
if it&amp;rsquo;s just slideware, but ive been giving this live demo which needs a real IDE.
 - I bring my iPad - originally I thought I would use this if I was at a conference and not presenting - I can take notes, write blog pots, stay up
 to date. Turns out I usually need rhe laptop too, if only because I was supposed to be writing code for the day job so
 I needed rhe IDE even if I was going to other sessions or waiting my turn to present. I tried not bringing the iPad,
 but the battery life on tje laptop was around 3-4 hours, which barely cuts it on a european flight, if you include
 airportnwaiting time, and certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t lastna trqnsatlantic journey. so I use the iPad for watching stuff on planes
 and anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t need an IDE, as the batteryblife is (or was, before tje ladt upgrade) much better. and saves precious pjone battery
  - if I have space, and tjink I might have time for a blog or notes, I&amp;rsquo;ll bring my bamboo tab&amp;rsquo;et.  I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t
  illustrsted my blognposts for quire a while, and very fww of my presentations have featured my pictures either, but
  I still optimisitically bring my bamboo tablet with me on many of my journies.  It&amp;rsquo;s not very heavy, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a
  big deal to bring it, but it;s just another piece of baggage (and another thing to plu in to the limited USB slots on
  the laptop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could have one device that:
 - Was slim and light
 - Lets me run IntelliJ IDEA
 - Can be presented from
 - Lets me easily sketch, preferably with Gimp or a similar tool
 - Has a decent battery life (needs to last for most of a transatlantic flight)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the optional benefits of
 - Being small enough that when the passenger in front of me smushes his seat back into my space it doesn&amp;rsquo;t snap the
 laptop screen
 - Being light enough/tablety enough that I can use it on take off and landing (do you know how much valuable working
 time is lost on each flight??)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my life would be simpler, and Simpler Is Better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I discovered the Surface, I very nearly downgraded to the smaller MacBook Air to meet those last two criteria, but
I was really worried about losing the screen real estate. I hate coding through a letter box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the Surface intrigued me.  Apart from being Windows, it might meet all my criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Taking the Plunge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played with it a bit in the pub that nivht, and I tried it in fnac to see if I hared the feel of the kayboard.  At the end of
my time at MongoDB, I switched to working on my (Windows) gaming PC, to see if lsoing all the familiar keyboard shortcuts
was a problem, to remember how to use Home and End keys instead of Fn and arrows (for some reason, text navigation on
the Mac was one of my deciding factors for switching to it in the first place), and to see if I remembered how to run things on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the airport (woah, you&amp;rsquo;d never think to find me at one of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt;), Dixons was doing a deal on the Surface, and also
offering a 60 day return-it-if-you-don&amp;rsquo;t-like-it guarantee.  I took the chance, and I bought the i5, 8Gb, 256 Gb option
(the memory was a bonus, but I always ran out of space on the iPad and the 128Gb Air if I put even half a dozen TV episodes
on there for watching on the plane).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decIDEd to use it as my primary coding machine for my new job, and to evaluate its performance. I&amp;rsquo;d send it back to
Dixons if I decIDEd I wanted to stick with a Mac (by the way, I&amp;rsquo;d had the Surface just a few hours before my iPad went
missing, it seems &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; in the house who is not me decIDEd that the iPad was decIDEdly his now, regardless of the outcome
of the experiment.  I dunno, some people&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Insert picture of a chart of your feelings towards the Surface)
The first week using the thing was pretty rough, and I was pretty certain during that time that I would be wrapping it up
and sending it back.  But because I thought I would be doing this (and at the point it looked like a refurbished MacBook Air
was definitely in my future, for free), I had nothing to lose by really trying to use the thing in anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a new job was a good excuse for all the setup too, I think making the switch while I was mid-flow in deliverables
would have been hard, but since I had new software to install and new credentials to set up anyway, the setup cost was
acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 1:
Bear in mind that during this time I&amp;rsquo;m using the Surface as a desktop replacement - I&amp;rsquo;ve got it in my home office and
I want to use it with a second monitor. I&amp;rsquo;m used to having the bluetooth keyboard and touchpad for the mac, and having the
laptop on a riser (insert photo of all the technology from that first day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1:
 - I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that the MacBook keyboard and touchpad actually do work with the surface.  Great! I can use my old setup!  Only&amp;hellip;
 - &amp;hellip;yes the machine sees the trackpad, but none of the gestures work, not even scrolling.  However, I do find some drivers from
 somewhere that give me scrolling support, except&amp;hellip;
 - &amp;hellip;the trackpad scrolls the wrong way. Not just the wrong way for what I&amp;rsquo;m used to on the mac (and many of us remember that
 day we had to switch directions when Apple inflicted that update on us, only now we wonder how we ever managed the old way), but
 the wrong way for the touchpad on the surface.  So I scroll in one direction on the mac trackpad, and in the opposite direction on
 the surface trackpad.  This is going to mess with my mind
 - The mac touchpad now supports a light tap as a click, instead of having to press to click - if you haven&amp;rsquo;t used the mac touchpad, you
 might not know what I mean, as the tap-click is quite common on other laptops. But it was FAR too sensitive, and I kept clicking on
 everything.  Drove me NUTS
 - Apple keyboard works.  There&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant surprise!
 - The resolution on my external monitor looks a bit crappy actually - the screen manages to look jagged and blurry at
 the same time.  The experience on the second monitor (insert specs here) was definitely better on the MacBook
 - On the first day, I wrote a note that says &amp;ldquo;function keys don&amp;rsquo;t work, or don&amp;rsquo;t do what they say on the tin&amp;rdquo;. Reading it
  now I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that means, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t really stumbled over it since then.  But I just tried pressing the ones that
  look like screen brightness, and they opened new tabs in Chrome. Which wasn&amp;rsquo;t even open.  That was unexpected. I also miss having
  volume on the function keys, they were pretty much the only ones I used on the mac. I think I set the defaults of the Surface
  to use the fucntion keys as F-keys (not search or brightness or whatever) so my shortcuts in IntelliJ worked correctly,
  but I can&amp;rsquo;t swear to that. I seem to remember doing that on the MacBook too.
 - Obviously adjusting to the Ctrl/Cmd differences, particularly in my IntelliJ shortcuts, was (and still is) tripping me up. But I&amp;rsquo;m
 OK with this, as even 2 years after switching from Linux to mac for full-time development, I still kept getting the mac shortcuts wrong
 anyway
 - I have a note that says &amp;ldquo;function key doesn&amp;rsquo;t do home/end&amp;rdquo; - this is definitely not true right now, so either I
 changed a setting, or this applies to using the mac keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2:
 - I think I disabled a click setting for the laptop touchpad, there&amp;rsquo;s no need for a tap-to-click when you also have
 a click on the touchpad.
 - This right-click thing on the touchpad drives me MENTAL. For whatever reason, I tend to use the lower right part of the
 touchpad to click, and since the whole right sIDE of the touchpad seems to be mapped to right-click, it means I&amp;rsquo;m almsot
 always right clicking on things instead of clicking. I looked for a way to turn this off, but it appears there is none.
 On the mac, I never really used this two-fingers-is-a-right-click feature, because I have a freakishly long middle finger and
 it was uncomfortable, so I tended to hold down alt to get a right-click. I have wished &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve used the surface for
 an Alt=right-click feature.
 - Skype didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. Honestly I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the problems, but I know it was for calls not chat. It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous
 that the windows version is worse than the OSX version, given who owns it, but hey. I have used Skype several times, sometimes
 to call via Skype, sometimes to call a UK phone line. The UK phone call was horrible, but then it always was on the mac too,
 the other end can never hear me, and on both the surface and the phone it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to correctly transmit keypad presses,
 I.e. when the voicejail system on the other end says &amp;ldquo;press 3 to attempt to speak to a real human&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3:
 - The pen is really nice.  And I&amp;rsquo;ve played with the handwriting recognition in Evernote, which is surprisingly good.  Actually, I might start
 using that rather than the screen keyboard - I started writing this post with the screen keyboard, and this is what I got:
&amp;gt;  I bring my iPad - originally I thought inwould usenthis if I was at a conference and not presenting - I can take norew, wrire blog pots, stay up
   to date. Turnsnout I usually need rhe laptop too, if only becausen I was supposednto be writing code for tje day job so
   I needed rhe IDE even if I was going to other sessions or waiting my turn tonpresent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the handwriting recognition is better than my finger positioning.
 - The screen keyboard is actually pretty nice, and the noises it makes are really cute. Took me a while to work out that
 you don&amp;rsquo;t get any autocorrect or automatic sentence capitlisation in Desktop mode, but you do if you&amp;rsquo;re running as a tablet.
 What this basically means is I&amp;rsquo;ve had to install two versions of evernote - the Windows desltop version, because it&amp;rsquo;s good and
 does everything I want, and &amp;ldquo;Evernote touch&amp;rdquo;, the tablet/phone version, which I had originally installed by accIDEnt and immediately
 uninstalled and replaced with the desktop app, as the tablet app seems to be missing pretty much everything, plus it looks
 completely difference, and I can&amp;rsquo;t find anything.  I re-installed it though, as if I&amp;rsquo;m going to write notes on-the-move
with the screen keyboard, I need to use the touch version so my horrible typing errors get fixed.
 - I expect to be able to scroll touching the screen in Evernote for desktop, but you can&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s bascially a mouse click. You
 can scroll in Evernote Touch though, presumably that&amp;rsquo;s been deisgned for it.
 - I struggle with the onscreen keyboard on this day, but I figure stuff out, including that there&amp;rsquo;s a different button that
 you have to press if you want the keyboard to not overlay the things you want to look at or do stuff with
  - Scrolling doesn&amp;rsquo;t work properly in Tweetdeck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4:
 - Honestly, did we really used to go to random websites to download software to install? It seems really fraught with danger.
 I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise how much I&amp;rsquo;d got used to the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has sounded more like a Technology Anonymous rant than a serious review of the surface. Ah well, if anyone can help me with any of
 my problems, I consIDEr it a win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that drive me crazy:
 - The laptop touchpad:
   &amp;ndash; The scrolling doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work, and isn&amp;rsquo;t always smooth. I Often end up using the arrow keys
   &amp;ndash; The right click on the right sIDE is &lt;em&gt;insanely&lt;/em&gt; annoying
   &amp;ndash; To be fair, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the surface has a particularly bad touchpad, I remember that pretty much all laptops before
   I used the MacBook had horrible touchpads.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably pretty good compared to other laptops, it&amp;rsquo;s just really nowhere
   near as good as the apple touchpads - both the one built into the laptop and the magic external one are excellent.
 - The mac touchpad.  The backwards scrolling and &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; click sensitivity was too much, and I stopped using it
 - Scrolling doesn&amp;rsquo;t work properly in Tweetdeck - if I hover over a column and scroll with the touchpad, it scrolls the column
 to the left.  Very, very annoying.  I end up using the arrow keys a LOT for scrolling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compromises/sacrifices I can take (AKA stuff Microsoft could address to make the Surface and/or Win):
 - The resolution on the second monitor.  Hated it at first, have got used to it.
 - Keyboard is not backlit.  This is irritating, but not currently a showstopped. But I have yet to try and use it on
 an overnight flight yet - I always loved the backlit keyboard on the mac at those times
 - Remapping the keys.  As per Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s super useful blogpost, I&amp;rsquo;ve remapped the right Alt key to Ins just so
 my IntelliJ shortcuts don&amp;rsquo;t all have to be remapped
 - Having a touchscreen monitor, whether it&amp;rsquo;s because your screen is also a tablet, or because you have an actual touchscreen,
 means your screen &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; has fingerprints all over it.  Not cool for my OCD. But irritates me a lot less than expected.
 - I keep pressing Windows Key + E instead of Ctrl+E (on the mac it was Cmd+e, and the cmd key is obviously in the same place as the windows
 key).  Thi is very irritating, but at some point my muscle memory will learn.
 - I have the Desktop and Tablet versions of some apps: Evernote (so I can use the proper version most of the time,
 but get the benefits of the cleverer screen keyboard in Evernote Touch) and Kindle (so I can use the Desktop
 version for opening books from Dropbox, and for searching, and all the other useful features from the desktop Kindle app
 that I used all the time on the mac, and the Tablet version so the font is actually visible when reading as a table, so
 the books are big enough icons to tap on with your finger).
 -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I miss about the mac:
 - Volume on function keys
 - Battery life indicator - time left in hours.  27% remaining is not too useful, I need to know how many hours that is.
 - The input box at the top of every help menu - I&amp;rsquo;m super lazy and used this all the time to type in the function I wanted to
 use, and OSX would highlight where in the menus this feature lived. IntelliJ has its Ctrl+Shift+A shortcut, which does
 something similar (only better), but for all other apps I end up hunting through menus for the thing I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that worked:
 - The MacBook bluetooth keyboard. Sure, the keys are in a different place (espectially as my bluetooth keyboard is
 Spanish and I purposefully bought a UK keyboard for the Surface), but it does work. I just don&amp;rsquo;t use it as without
 a separate mouse or touchpad, I might as well use the surface keyboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I like
 - Once I got used to the very light touch that is the Surface keyboard, I think I prefer it.  It&amp;rsquo;s a nice feeling -
 kinda clicky, kinda squishy like laptop keyboards are, but such a short distance to push the keys down it actually feels
 very low effort, like your brain is able to talk to the computer with minimal resistance.
 - Windows Key + S opens up the search, which works like the apple spotlight (Cmd+Space). I thought I would really miss
 this feature, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad there&amp;rsquo;s an equivalent. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t taken long to retrain my muscle memory.
 - Honestly, getting a full Delete key back on the keyboard is surprisingly pleasing. Fn+Backspace has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; annoyed
 me, especially in shortcuts in an IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that still need more testing
 - Battery life: Today I
   &amp;ndash; used the surface as a tablet and watched 40 minutes of vIDEo in the gym
   &amp;ndash; spent 20 minutes or so sketching (with the pen) an architecture diagram for my boyfriend while we waited in the aiport
   (yep, that&amp;rsquo;s the sort of relationship we have.  Poor boy.)
   &amp;ndash; have been using it for 90 minutes on the plane
   &amp;ndash; &amp;hellip;and I&amp;rsquo;m down to 17%.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty disapointed with this.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the specs are supposed to
   be, and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain I could do more to save battery (for example it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in flight mode until I got it onto the plane,
   and the screen was at normal brightness until about 30 minutes ago when I realised I was under 30% battery).
   &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d like to test how long it lasts on a flight from full charge, with some reasonable power-saving settings. But I&amp;rsquo;m worried
   it won&amp;rsquo;t take me all the way across the Atlantic, and with only a single toy, instead of the laptop/iPad combo, I have
   no backups for Things To Do when the power is out.
(2 hours into the flight and 7%)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions:
 - I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s a solid desktop replacement: the poor resolution on the second monitor, and the fact the second monitor
 totally throws off the pen use on the tablet make this more of a nice laptop than a great desktop replacement
 - Battery life is disappointing, but needs investigation
 - For travelling, I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is going to be a great choice
 - And for encouraging creativity and different modes of working, it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic. I&amp;rsquo;ve sketched more in the last month than
 the last year, and switching from keyboard to touch screen to pen is really easy and allows you to work in different ways
  to traditional laptops or desktops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep the Surface (I think). The laptop/tablet combo, with the fantastic stylus support, is worth the sacrifices.
Although I prefer OSX overall as an OS, Apple has nothing to compete with this hardware right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Workshop: AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/resources/angular_java_groovy_mongodb_workshop/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Setup required for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/tutorial/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together&#34;&gt;AngularJS/HTML5/Groovy/Java/MongoDB tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for QCon London 2015.
Sign up with code SPEAKGEE100 for £100 off the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Who is this for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop is aimed at Java developers who want to learn more about how
to rapidly prototype applications using web front-end technologies with JVM back-end technologies. The workshop may be
suitable for developers who don&amp;rsquo;t normally use Java as their primary language,
but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an introduction to Java and familiarity with server-side development of some kind is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript is expected, but previous experience of Groovy or MongoDB is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop is not suitable for people who have no programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on workshop, bring a laptop set up according to the following instructions - you will be writing code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/klw9pIuTICM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created my very first screencast! This video takes you through all the steps you need to go through in order to be
setup for the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup instructions below are the same process, so you can copy &amp;amp; paste where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you already have a version of the Java SDK downloaded. For this workshop, Java 7 or above should work, but
I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html&#34;&gt;download the latest version of Java 8&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re not already using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new work area for this tutorial. For the rest of these instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve put
 mine in &lt;code&gt;~/Projects/workshops/qcon2015&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Installing MongoDB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;MongoDB 3.0.0-rc8&lt;/a&gt;, but version 2.6 will be fine too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;Download MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system and unzip/install it.  Unless you prefer to put it
somewhere else, I suggest you unzip it to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/mongodb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have to create the directory for the data to go into. Create a &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so that you
have a folder at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the command line, start MongoDB to make sure everything is working.  From the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Windows:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;monogdb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
MongoDB should be running on localhost and port 27017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect to the shell to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;monogdb\bin\mongo.exe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You should see something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~\Projects\workshops\qcon2015&amp;gt;monogdb\bin\mongo.exe
MongoDB shell version: 2.8.0-rc5
connecting to: test
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.

Questions? Try the support group
        http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user
&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_8&#34;&gt;Creating your project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;the Cafelito project&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/cafelito&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a terminal/command line, navigate to this location, and run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_9&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./gradlew check
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_10&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gradlew.bat check
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This should download all the required dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open in your favourite IDE and import this directory as a new project. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 14&lt;/a&gt; and showing a number of its tricks. If you&amp;rsquo;re using IntelliJ IDEA and you
import this project as a Gradle project, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to do the above step, IntelliJ will download and import
the dependencies for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use Eclipse or
Netbeans (or whatever your favourite IDE is) but I&amp;rsquo;m out of practice using those IDEs and might not be able to help you out as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_11&#34;&gt;And now&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be ready to begin: you have a working instance of MongoDB, a skeleton project that we&amp;rsquo;ll be working with, and all the
dependencies should have been downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Struggle to Have It All</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/having_it_all/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/having_it_all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I watched the final episode of Season 5 of Castle (yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit behind).  I love Castle - I heart Nathan
Filion, I have a secret desire to be a novelist, and I love crime programs and books, so it basically it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect TV
program for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you&amp;rsquo;re further behind on the series, then maybe don&amp;rsquo;t read on in case I spoil something, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try not to be too specific)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode Kate Beckett basically is put into a position of deciding between her man and her career - she is offered
a job that will give her a serious career boost, greater visibility, and theoretically provide her with the scope to use
her skills on cases that are more interesting and have greater impact than the ones she currently works on.  But the job
is not quite perfect, as it requires a relocation.  This would take her away from her bloke, and presumably the bloke is
not able to move for her job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the relationship with the guy has been going for nearly a year, is going well, and it&amp;rsquo;s the most committed
Kate has been to a guy (according to hints dropped by her father in the episode).  She&amp;rsquo;s been happy in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show basically puts her into a position of choosing between her career and her man, and she has to ask herself which
one she wants more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think many of us, and not just the ladies, have been put into a position of deciding between our job and, well, pretty
much anything in the rest of our lives. But often our job and our family - be that our actual family (our spouse, kids,
parents etc) or our boyfriends/girlfriends and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can sympathise with her position - I was effectively single for quite a few years in my late twenties / early thirties, which made it
very easy to focus on career - not because I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to, or had nothing else, but because I wanted to. I enjoyed it and I
got a lot out of it.  The first time I got into a more serious relationship, it really did feel like a choice between
my relationship and my career.  But the real question I knew I needed to answer was: what makes me happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job certainly gave me a lot of satisfaction, the stuff around the edges of the job (blogging, starting this evangelism
thing, the LJC, being involved in the JCP) even more so - particularly as they opened up opportunities for travel and
meeting new, interesting people that being sat at a desk from 9-6 does not always give you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But having a partner, someone to share the travels with, someone to tell the stories of what happened at work to, and
someone to share the rest of my time with, was something I wanted, something that had been missing.  And you can&amp;rsquo;t just
squeeze that into the few remaining hours of your week, you have to make time for it, invest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consciously had to go through all my activities and ask myself for each one: does this directly add to my happiness? The
ones which required more time and gave less immediate benefit (or a less measurable future benefit) had to go.  Some of
the others that I enjoyed, like attending user groups, were cut down - you can still get a large chunk of the benefits
with a smaller investment of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I choose a boyfriend over my career? No. My career, surprisingly, still continued - in the direction I wanted, at a
pace which still satisfied me (and was a much higher pace than I had imagined was required in my mid-thirties). What I
chose was to value my happiness above anything else.  Not &amp;ldquo;my boyfriend makes me happy so I will ditch everything for him&amp;rdquo;,
no, I reduced activities that were not obviously adding to my happiness and valued activities with the boyfriend that did
(note - I have also ditched boyfriends who did not add to my happiness, although sometimes not fast enough).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Kate Beckett - what is she supposed to do?   The writers have obviously created a situation where she faces a
distinct either/or choice, she can&amp;rsquo;t reduce in one area to invest in another, she has a binary choice.  And of course,
this job offer is presented as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  On the other hand, her man is offering her the
happy-ever-after we&amp;rsquo;re all supposed to desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s clarify two things:
1) Once in a lifetime opportunities come up much more than you&amp;rsquo;d think. Life is cyclical, you end up in similar situations
to your past, where you thought you&amp;rsquo;d ended that particular phase of your life.  And if you&amp;rsquo;re right for a particular job,
role, company, team but the time isn&amp;rsquo;t right, you&amp;rsquo;ll still be right for a job, role, company or team just like that one in
the future when the time is right.  Don&amp;rsquo;t panic, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to take it NOW NOW NOW just because it will NEVER come up
again. That particular thing might not come up again, but something that pushes those buttons in you will, because you&amp;rsquo;re that
sort of person looking for that sort of opportunity, and people see that and value that.
2) Happily ever after doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK too. You can&amp;rsquo;t make the perfect &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo; last forever, we all change, we
all grow, and that&amp;rsquo;s a Good Thing.  The best we can do is do the things that make use more-or-less happy now, preferably
the ones that don&amp;rsquo;t prevent us finding happiness in future (i.e. immediate gratification isn&amp;rsquo;t what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about,
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about trying to get onto a happiness curve that will, if not always increase, will at least not become a downwards spiral).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TV and movies want us to believe that life is binary like this, that we have to make choices.  And yet us women have also
been told we can Have It All - a fantastic, well paid, satisfying career, a loving husband and wonderful family, a perfect
clean and tidy house, and a sportscar. OK, I added the sportscar, but my forward-thinking girls&amp;rsquo; school told me
I could be anything I wanted to be, and I want to be the owner of a sportscar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, life&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily rammed with these binary choices that scriptwriters force on our poor heroines, but it&amp;rsquo;s not
possible to have it all either.  I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry. I think this is a big disapppointment to us generation X-ers, and unacceptable
to generation Y (although I read the difference between the generations is that X expects to work hard to earn it all,
and Y expects to just have it all, but I expect that was written by a generation X person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story about having it all.  Once upon a time, when I was young, I moved in with my boyfriend. I enjoyed
playing house, having my first real place (sharing a house at university doesn&amp;rsquo;t really count). During the first year,
I was in my final year at university, and although I had lectures, coursework and a final year project, I was at home a
lot of the time and had time to do the housework type stuff.  It was fun, it was my place and I liked looking after it.
One thing I did NOT do, having spent two years at university without access to an iron or ironing board, was ironing. I
never really agreed with the boring chore anyway, so I invested in clothes that didn&amp;rsquo;t need it.  My boyfriend, however,
wore shirts to work every day.  Shirts that, in my opinion, might was well not have been ironed - my boyfriend knew how to
iron and did the chore weekly, but not to my rather-too-high standards. I remember thinking &amp;ldquo;what will work colleagues
think of me?&amp;ldquo;. I expected that they would assume that his girlfriend either couldn&amp;rsquo;t iron or didn&amp;rsquo;t take care of him. This
thought mortified me for a long time. I thought I could start ironing his shirts just to ease my conscience.  Or teach him
to iron to my standards. Or I could, maybe, just let go of this issue - it was the 21st century (only just) and people
surely couldn&amp;rsquo;t expect men&amp;rsquo;s girlfriends to be responsbile for how the man looked. We got a lady to come and do our
ironing, that fixed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year or so, I ended up working at Ford motor company.  It was a good job,
paid well (especially for graduates like me), was relatively local, and was 7.5 hours a day. Because of the unions, we tended
to actually keep to those hours.  This meant that although now I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at home as much as before, I still had more time
there than my boyfriend, who worked longer hours and commuted into London. I still had time to keep the flat as clean and
tidy as I wanted (the boyfriend did help, by the way, before you start thinking he was some sort of lazy monster, it&amp;rsquo;s just
that I like things really tidy so I would do the extra that made me happy), and to go to the gym after work, and I could still
pick him up from the station when his train got in. I had it all - a boyfriend, a decent (but boring) job, time at home for my
own things. The boring job even allowed me time to stay in touch with my best friend who was in Korea at the time (God Bless
instant messenger) and do all those boring housey things you have to do, like chase the phone company, organise deliveries,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the job was boring, and I was not happy - I wasn&amp;rsquo;t stretched or challenged, I put all my energies into things like organising my parents&amp;rsquo;
silver wedding anniversary, buying our first house, arranging (what felt like) all of our get-togethers with friends. I had time
for friends at home but, with one notable exception, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have friends like me at work. So I got a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I LOVED this job - they made me read things, learn about Effective Java, about XP &amp;amp; Agile. It was in London, so I had
plenty of time on the commute to read all this stuff.  We went out after work for (company paid-for) drinks every Friday
night. I was hanging out with people a few years older than me, instead of graduates like me and &amp;ldquo;old men&amp;rdquo; - I had found
a whole generation of people I didn&amp;rsquo;t know were missing from Ford.  I kept going to the gym, more or less, I started running
at lunchtimes, and I now worked 9-6 and went out for drinks after work at least once a week. It was one of the best times of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought a second property, a flat in London.  Once again, I was in charge of this, chasing the solictor and estate agents
and mortgage people, making sure everything was in place.  This was much more difficult this time - I no longer had space
in my work day to just drop everything and hang around on the phone. I no longer remembered to do a lot of these things,
my brain was taken up with the interesting challenges. I worked on prototypes at home at the weekend, I travelled a bit to
speak to customers.  I had fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we lived our lives split between two homes, and the things we needed always seemed to be at the other home. We
cleaners for our house, as I had no time or inclination to keep it as clean and tidy as it had once been. And when my boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s
grandma came to visit our house, she pointed out the extreme lack of Trish toys and activities there. I slept there, but
 I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Part 2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m all about Continuous Learning - after I wrote the
&lt;a href=&#34;post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij&#34;&gt;last post about IntelliJ Tips&lt;/a&gt;, I carried on through my trawl of the documentation
and, of course, discovered a load more things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know.  And this is all just in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Quick+Start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the next batch (although once again I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts
are for Windows unless otherwise stated, and Mac users should be able to replace the Ctrl key with Cmd in all these
cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Navigate between methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I knew you could use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-2.Structure&#34;&gt;structure thingie&lt;/a&gt;
(Ctrl+F12) to let you navigate to methods in your class (although I never actually
use it, it somehow never sticks in my head).  What I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-5.Navigatebetweenmethods&#34;&gt;jump between methods&lt;/a&gt;
using Alt+Up/Down arrows.  This strikes me as being super useful, especially to browse tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Refactoring String Fragments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted this feature so many times, but could never find it or get it to work - did you know you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-4.Stringfragments&#34;&gt;refactor out parts of a
hardcoded string&lt;/a&gt;
into variable/field/constant? Select the section of the String you want to extract, and use the normal &amp;ldquo;Extract&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
shortcuts - e.g. Ctrl+Alt+V to extract it into a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it and it does!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Invert Boolean&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a keyboard shortcut mapped by default, but using &amp;ldquo;Refactor -&amp;gt; Invert Boolean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (or using
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/index.html#toc_0&#34;&gt;our newly discovered&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; shortcut of Shift+Ctrl+A and typing &amp;ldquo;Invert&amp;rdquo;) you can tell IntelliJ you want
a boolean field to mean the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; thing, and it will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-6.Invertboolean&#34;&gt;flip the meaning everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.
For example, you might have an &lt;code&gt;saved&lt;/code&gt; flag, and you now want it to mean &lt;code&gt;notSaved&lt;/code&gt; - IntelliJ will make sure the
&lt;code&gt;isSaved&lt;/code&gt; method returns &lt;code&gt;!notSaved&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Magic Refactor Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t always know exactly what refactoring operation you want to perform, and IntelliJ is ready to help - it can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-10.Refactorthis&#34;&gt;suggest refactorings available in the current context&lt;/a&gt;
using the catchy magic incantation Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T.  Seems useful, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m not going to remember that
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Highlight implemented/overridden methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love everything about IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s ability to find usages of things - finding where methods are called, finding
implementations of a method, highlighting usages of a field, method or variable&amp;hellip; What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Find+Usages#FindUsages-6.Highlightimplementedandoverriddenmethods&#34;&gt;highlight the methods that implement or override a specific interface or superclass&lt;/a&gt;.
For some people, this might not add much, as your little &amp;ldquo;I override something&amp;rdquo; icon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/override.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; title=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;combined with the &lt;code&gt;@Override&lt;/code&gt; annotation, might tell you all you need to know. But that only really works if you&amp;rsquo;re implementing a
a single interface.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve correctly separated your concerns, you might implement several interfaces, and want to know
which are the methods from a particular one.  That&amp;rsquo;s where Shift+Ctrl+F7 on the &amp;ldquo;extends&amp;rdquo; keyword comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Run individual inspection by name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections&#34;&gt;inspections&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot.  They&amp;rsquo;re especially
useful if you have a codebase that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite conform to your ideal standards, so you can&amp;rsquo;t yet turn on automated
checks like checkstyle to break the build when the code doesn&amp;rsquo;t
conform - there&amp;rsquo;s an initial step where first you need to clean up the code.  Inspections are great, because you can
have IntelliJ give you little yellow marks to show where things are suboptimal, and aim to check in only files without
little yellow marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-6.Runasingleinspection&#34;&gt;run a single inspection&lt;/a&gt;
on files in any scope.  So if, for example, you wanted to
make sure that the code you&amp;rsquo;ve touched in this change has no unused bits, like
unused parameters or unused/untested methods, you could press Shift+Alt+Ctrl+I and type &amp;ldquo;unused&amp;rdquo;. Select the
&amp;ldquo;Unused Declaration&amp;rdquo; inspection and choose to run this on all uncommitted files.  This will tell you where you can
clean up your code, and every commit should make your codebase that little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Saving Power With Highlighting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know you could easily &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-7.Highlightinglevelandpowersavemode&#34;&gt;alter the active errors/warnings&lt;/a&gt;,
and use that to save power.  Quite Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_7&#34;&gt;Auto indent your lines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost obsessively reformat my code as I go, pressing &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-1.Reformatcode&#34;&gt;Ctrl+Alt+L&lt;/a&gt;
almost like a muscle twitch. What I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered, though, is that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-2.Autoindentlines&#34;&gt;shortcut which will just fix the line
indentation&lt;/a&gt;,
which is probably 80% of what I need anyway - Ctrl+Alt+I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_8&#34;&gt;Fix Evil String Concatenation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this one earlier - do you know how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve gone around and manually changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.println(&amp;quot;This thing &amp;quot; + something + &amp;quot; is &amp;quot; + somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.printf(&amp;quot;This thing %s is %s%n&amp;quot;, something, somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you??? Anyway you don&amp;rsquo;t need to - Alt+Enter inside the params &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Intentions#Intentions-2.Stringconcatenation&#34;&gt;will suggest the replacement and do it for
you&lt;/a&gt;. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_9&#34;&gt;VCS Quick Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t use IntelliJ to the best of its abilities is the Git integration.  I&amp;rsquo;ve
been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/&#34;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; combined with IntelliJ to do most of my VCS management
(I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m just not a command line
person, I need to actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it). With the new laptop, I haven&amp;rsquo;t installed SourceTree yet and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and
do everything via the IDE.  Previously I used the right-click menu mostly for managing VCS operations, occasionally the
VCS menu, and did most stuff in the &amp;ldquo;Changes&amp;rdquo; window.  But now I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Alt+&amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; (Ctrl+V on the mac) to
bring up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Version+Control+Basics#VersionControlBasics-4.VCSoperationsquicklist&#34;&gt;menu of git-shaped operations for this
context&lt;/a&gt;.
To stop you having to hunt all over the keyboard to
find what on earth a &amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; is, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;#96;, which on both my UK and US (Windows) keyboards is in the top left
corner of your keyboard (on the Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s on the bottom left next to the shift, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need it since your
shortcut is different anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_10&#34;&gt;Amend Commits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered that you can commit a change which smushes up into your last commit and fixes it.  I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it commits the
new changes and (potentially) an updated commit message into the last change.  I really wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about this
earlier, on a number of occasions in the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve done this either manually or by doing a rather
dangerous soft reset.  I will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; be using this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/amend-commit.png&#34; alt=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; title=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_11&#34;&gt;The Cursor as a Breakpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Debugger#Debugger-5.Runtocursor&#34;&gt;use the cursor as a temporary breakpoint&lt;/a&gt;?
I did not.  Well, now you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_12&#34;&gt;Labelling Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by now none of us developers are doing that icky thing of having &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee/status/529299964787449856&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Copy of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Backup of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; filenames
and directories&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of our versions.  We&amp;rsquo;re all using a VCS of course.  But if you&amp;rsquo;re being strict about making
sure that every commit leads to a working build (we all do that, right&amp;hellip;?) then sometimes even distributed file systems
like git, with its local branches, are too heavyweight for experiments and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ has Local History, which I personally think you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rely on, but has occasionally saved my bacon in
times of strife.  It also does this really nice thing (automatically) where it labels versions where the tests passed,
so you&amp;rsquo;ve got some level of confidence that at that point in time, at that revision, things weren&amp;rsquo;t hideously broken.
At the very least, they must have compiled.  What I did not know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Local+History#LocalHistory-6.Putlabel&#34;&gt;add your own labels&lt;/a&gt;, so you could
label some local, non-committed version of the file as &amp;ldquo;feature x works but y doesn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; (or probably something much
shorter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it looks useful. As I say though, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a replacement for VCS, but a suppliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
So, that&amp;rsquo;s the end of Week One at JetBrains, and already I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole heap of things.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s more to
come, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Today</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Day three of my &lt;a href=&#34;/post/new_year_new_adventures&#34;&gt;brand new job&lt;/a&gt; - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&amp;rsquo;m
already a &amp;ldquo;Power User&amp;rdquo;, to see if there&amp;rsquo;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; read it.  Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&amp;rsquo;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what, today I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously known,
and they&amp;rsquo;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&amp;rsquo;t know was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s today&amp;rsquo;s list, and feel free to laugh at me and be smug in my direction if you already knew these things (note: I
have upgraded to IntelliJ 14, and at the time of writing I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of these features are new and which are
simply previously undiscovered):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Navigate directly to an action or option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Cmd+A (Mac) and start typing the name of the thing you want to do, or the setting
you want to change. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this especially useful now I&amp;rsquo;m back on Windows and I don&amp;rsquo;t have that nice helpful typing
box on the help menu that will take me straight to the menu item I want.  But what&amp;rsquo;s most useful about this for me today,
as I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a new profile on a new laptop (more on the new laptop later, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t defeat me utterly) is that
from here, you can turn various settings on and off without having to navigate through the settings screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/action.png&#34; alt=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; title=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Statement completion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew there was a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-4.Statementcompletion&#34;&gt;shortcut for finishing off a statement&lt;/a&gt;,
all that Java boilerplate you need to keep the compiler happy - semi colons and curly brackets and everything.  But
there is, and I can see it being super useful, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using other bits of IntelliJ code completion to
create the core of your line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Issue tracker integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure loads of people are already using integration with their favourite issue tracker, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought
about this as something that I really cared about.  But I was watching the intro videos for YouTrack (not surprisingly
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this instead of Jira during my time at JetBrains) and when I saw
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2_3Y1jLm5U&#34;&gt;how the IDE integration worked&lt;/a&gt;, I
suddenly realised how this small thing can add up to save thousands of keystrokes over time, not to mention saving
precious navigational seconds and window-switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, just the ability to generate at least the start of the commit message is a saving in time, and adds to project
consistency if all your developers are doing the same thing.  On my last project we only just realised we all quoted the
Jira issues in subtly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Settings shortcut keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I initially started using IntelliJ in anger back in 2008, I was very much a point-and-click type user. Over time,
pair programming with keyboard-super-users and giving live demos with very limited time available, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked harder
to become a keyboard-shortcuts person.  With the latest version of IntelliJ, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the tiny icons I use to get to
the settings window, something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot as I set up the new IDE instance on the new laptop.  So I bit
the bullet and learnt the keyboard shortcuts, and it&amp;rsquo;s already saving me a bunch of time (on the rare occasions when the
aforementioned &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; fails me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ctrl+Alt+S for the settings dialog (appears to be Cmd + , on the Mac)
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+S for the project structure dialog (appears to be Cmd + ; on the Mac)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; title=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t already using those either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Selecting the negative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use completion/suggestions all the time from IntelliJ, I&amp;rsquo;m far too lazy to type everything.  What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise, is
that you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to accept the default they give you.  If, for example, IntelliJ suggests a boolean value, you
can get it to negate that value by selecting it with &amp;ldquo;!&amp;rdquo; instead of enter or tab.  Yes, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve done a horrible job
of explaining that, but take a look at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-5.Negatingcompletion&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;
and try it, it&amp;rsquo;s quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Exclude from Autocomplete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of code completion, sometimes IntelliJ is sometimes just a bit too keen to suggest something, and you really
will never want that value.  In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used &lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Auto Import&lt;/code&gt; to manage the
suggestions (the most common one for me is I will never want &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;, I will almost always want
&lt;code&gt;java.util.List&lt;/code&gt;).  Well, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go into settings to do this, you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-9.Excludefromcompletion&#34;&gt;do it from the suggestions themselves&lt;/a&gt; -
navigate to the item you don&amp;rsquo;t want (in my case, &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;) and press Alt+Enter, this will give you the option
of excluding this from the suggestions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I found from just one day of browsing the documentation and setting up my IDE from scratch yet again.
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll promptly forget all these, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll be new weapons in my armoury of IDE-fu. Either way, maybe one or
two people will find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Year, New Adventures</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/new_year_new_adventures/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/new_year_new_adventures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just over two years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;/post/and_for_my_next_trick/&#34;&gt;I embarked upon a journey&lt;/a&gt; as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then
called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB Inc&lt;/a&gt;). My goals for
this role were: to learn what it was
like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to
level up my advocacy skills.  I have met all these goals, and more - I met some fantastic people; learnt different approaches to
software development; discovered my new favourite database for creating applications; moved to Spain; started both a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;;
worked to understand the value of community and evangelism, and to help create a strategy for these areas;
and my evangelism efforts and open source work earned me the &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/website/java-champions/bios.html#Gee&#34;&gt;Java Champion&lt;/a&gt; title.
I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud of what I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved over this period, and very grateful to MongoDB for giving me these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, a new adventure is about to begin.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen my &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt;
this year, you&amp;rsquo;ll know of my love affair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;,
a tool I use daily (even for blogging). Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m joining the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;,
where I&amp;rsquo;m going Full Advocate. I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; this means I get to carry on doing more of what I love - presenting, writing,
and working on demos to help developers become more productive. I hope this will give me opportunities to stay ahead of the curve in the
Java/JVM world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, in answer to the Most Frequently Asked Question, I am staying in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Sevilla and I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to
leave yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/Sevilla.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; title=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall leave you with my somewhat disasterous &amp;ldquo;Top Ten IntelliJ Tips&amp;rdquo; from GOTO Aarhus, which is worth watching just to see Dan North
save me from the curse of the live demo.  Things can only get better from here, right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Speaker Diversity</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/more_female_speakers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/more_female_speakers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically,
although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem,
only identify some issues and explore some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&amp;rsquo;t post it now I&amp;rsquo;ll never post it, and it&amp;rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and
posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Firstly, what stops people from stepping up to speak?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the very first thing any developer says when you ask them why they haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about presenting at conferences or user
groups. Turns out, you always have something to say.  For example, our most popular sessions at the Sevilla JUG and MUG are &amp;ldquo;Introduction
 to&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;. You hear from plenty of experts who have travelled the whole road to some pinnacle of excellence,
 but what many developers need is simply someone a couple of steps ahead of them to lead them forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always know more than &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know everything, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know more than everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I be role model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So many women feel this, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely sympathetic to this view point: I&amp;rsquo;m a woman developer, getting along, happy in my job,
happy being a programmer, why the hell should I have to stand up and present and blog and be a role model for other women? Men don&amp;rsquo;t have
to do that. Men can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the fear that if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stand up, become a role model, that somehow people will think you&amp;rsquo;re representing all
women developers. You&amp;rsquo;ll be worried because you can only represent who you are, what you do, you can&amp;rsquo;t represent a whole gender in a
single presentation or a single interview.  And the pressure! What if I mess up? What if I say something my gender does not agree with?
What if I say something that causes my whole gender to be judged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally understandable fears. Totally true that many people will ask you to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; woman developer, to answer for all women.  Well,
that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking more women to stand up, to be role models - if we all step up, it will no longer just be me, and you,
and that other one over there. There&amp;rsquo;ll be more of us, more differing voices, we&amp;rsquo;ll stand out less. But we have to stand up first.  And
in the meantime it&amp;rsquo;s us and our points of view they&amp;rsquo;re listening to. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you rather voice your opinion than have someone else speak
on your behalf? Especially when very few people really can represent you, who you are and what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised at what you do know, so people who present run into this less than you&amp;rsquo;d think, even if you&amp;rsquo;re just beginning,
but just in case here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the question, paraphrasing. Firstly, this ensures you&amp;rsquo;ve actually heard the question correctly. Secondly,
it allows the whole audience to hear it, and thirdly, but most importantly, it buys you time to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest - say you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and move on. If you know somewhere that might have the answer,
point the person to that resource.  But a technical audience actually values the answer &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; more than you think. Especially
the person who asked the question, it makes them feel really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, but you think the audience might know, throw it back to them. Either to the person who asked the question,
if that feels appropriate (especially if this is one of those &amp;ldquo;look how smart I am&amp;rdquo; questions),
or to the audience as a whole. In conferences in particular, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance someone there knows the answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re genuinely terrified of all questions, say at the start of the presentation that you won&amp;rsquo;t take questions in the talk. Offer
an alternative, like via Twitter or e-mail, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;What can conference organisers do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically invite the people you want presenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t just wait for them to submit. If you want more women, more diversity, invite them. And invite them early&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your women presenters early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recognise that there are relatively few women presenters on &amp;ldquo;the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and understand that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants them to speak at their
conference. This rare breed, the female technical presenter, gets booked up &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; in advance.  They&amp;rsquo;re probably as in-demand as your
keynote speakers, and can probably devote less time to appearing at conferences than those who have made it to keynote-standard (I&amp;rsquo;m
making a sweeping generalisation that your techy women have day-jobs as developers and your keynote speakers are either professional
presenters or at least can argue presenting as a critical part of their job).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have a limited resource (experienced women presenters) that&amp;rsquo;s in high demand. You need to reach out directly to them,
invite them, and secure them well in advance of your conference.  Many big conferences, for example JavaOne and QCon,
will invite speakers six months in advance. If you give women speakers a month&amp;rsquo;s notice before your conference or event,
they simply are not going to have the space in their schedule at that late notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showcase your diversity on your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory&#34;&gt;microaggressions&lt;/a&gt;,
go and read what that means before you get any further.  There&amp;rsquo;s a very simple thing you
need to do with your website, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve opened for CFP or you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get attendees to register - make sure the photos on your
website show the type of diversity you want to encourage.  Only yesterday I was looking at the website of a big conference,
who I know for a fact are working &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to ensure diversity, not just with gender but race, age,
and where possible in less physically obvious dimensions. The conference is many months off, so the only photo they have on the website
is a background photo of the exhibition hall from some previous year, crammed full of attendees - white, male attendees,
as far as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to tell.  It&amp;rsquo;s extremely subtle. You might not even notice, as the photo is behind the headers and text of the
site. But I noticed. And you can be sure the subconscious of every person who went to the website to either submit a proposal for a
talk, or is considering asking their employer to pay for the registration, also noticed.  The conscious mind might be able to shrug it
off.  But the subconscious of a non-white and/or non-male person notices and plants the subtle seed
of &amp;ldquo;this conference is not for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, conference and event organisers - if you want more women applying to speak at your conference,
show more women on your website.  If you want a more diverse audience, show more diverse faces.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve invited your women presenters
early and secured them early, show their photos on the site - this sends a strong message to other women that their talk proposals will be
taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run warm up nights to try out new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know conference organisers get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of submissions, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which are going to be good speakers,
especially if they&amp;rsquo;re new speakers or don&amp;rsquo;t have a video.  If you&amp;rsquo;re genuine about improving the diversity of your speakers,
run free nights to a) promote your conference and b) try out new speakers.  Probably a good idea to have a new speaker and a known
speaker to attract the crowd and give newbies a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be so damn picky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New speakers need to be encouraged. Find a way to see their content without just discarding an unknown name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing speakers might not have the luxury of creating new content. Many conferences want genuine practitioners,
not just evangelists, but those people have day jobs and can&amp;rsquo;t be creating a new talk just for your conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave space for new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;and don&amp;rsquo;t just have 7 slots for a pro speaker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at your swag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not just guys t-shirts.  One conference gave out cupcakes for example. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just have to be handbags and high-heeled shoes,
just take a quick look and see if your swag is generally useful for techies, or if it leans towards men only. Men only swag (men&amp;rsquo;s
t-shirts, bottle openers, subtle things like that) subliminally says &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t belong here&amp;rdquo; to the women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t tell every individual why they were rejected, but you could look at all the rejected submissions and give broad indications of
the type of CFPs that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Maybe write a blog post explaining which sorts of talks didn&amp;rsquo;t make it and why.  This will help
speakers create content that better fits your conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be specific about what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have tracks you&amp;rsquo;re finding content for, put them on the website/CFP, so people know what the topics are. If you have an
idea that you want 30% beginner material and 30% very advanced, make that clear too. Especially if you want &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; beginner or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
advanced. People will submit more appropriate talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a beginner&amp;rsquo;s track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;not just for the speakers, for the content too. Beginner speakers may be more comfortable presenting &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; talks.&lt;br /&gt;
Having a beginners track, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for content or speakers, will make newbies feel more included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;What other things can we try?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User groups can grow talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice writing CFPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning talks, book club, different meetup styles (like fishbowl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run an open conference to encourage new speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s user groups are instrumental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So here&amp;rsquo;s something interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m sceptical of all-women user groups as I feel it separates us from the communities we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
contributing to. But women&amp;rsquo;s user groups can help us to integrate better.  For example, Duchess France helped and encouraged its members
to submit talks to Devoxx, gave feedback on CFPs before they were submitted, and provided a safe place for the women to practice
presenting beforehand.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing women&amp;rsquo;s user groups could be fantastic for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Advice for budding speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Do It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more you do it, the more comfortable you&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker, it can make you feel less of an impostor at a conference - you&amp;rsquo;re not just a woman developer, you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s afraid, it&amp;rsquo;s not just you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer wants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience is on your side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Small (user groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be technical. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be super smart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrapping is hard - you haven&amp;rsquo;t presented so you can&amp;rsquo;t get into conferences. Again, user groups can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair. Ask a more experienced presenter if you can co-present with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is perfectly acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate there is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more I could have covered, and many topics deserve more depth. But this is the brain dump from the Devoxx
session, and maybe one day things will be expanded into their own topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developers want to be heard</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/other-sites/developers_want_to_be_heard/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/other-sites/developers_want_to_be_heard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How often have you been in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re in a meeting with the team, and you&amp;rsquo;re all discussing the implementation of a new feature. The group seems to be converging on a
design, but there&amp;rsquo;s something about it that feels off, some sort of &amp;ldquo;smell&amp;rdquo;.  You point this out to the team,
perhaps outlining the specific areas that make you uncomfortable. Maybe you even have an alternative solution. The team lets you have
your say, but assures you this is The Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or what about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tech lead asks you to fix a bug, and as you work on your implementation, you bounce ideas around periodically just to make sure
you&amp;rsquo;re on the right track.  Things seem to be OK,
until it comes to getting your code merged. Now, it becomes clear that your implementation is not what the lead had in
mind, and there&amp;rsquo;s a frustrating process of back-and-forth while you explain and defend your design decisions
whilst trying to incorporate the feedback. At the end, the solution doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like your work,
and you&amp;rsquo;re not entirely sure what was wrong with your initial implementation - it fixed the problem, passed the tests,
and met the criteria you personally think are important (readability / scalability / performance /
stability / time-to-implementation, whatever it is that you value).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you speak to women developers, you often hear &amp;ldquo;I feel like I have to work really hard to convince people about my ideas&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s
taken me a long time to prove my worth&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how to be seen as a full member of the team&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you hear these a lot from women because we &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; women a lot what they don&amp;rsquo;t like about their work,
since we&amp;rsquo;re (correctly) concerned as an industry about the lack of female developers and the alarming rate at which they leave technical
roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you ask &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; developer you&amp;rsquo;ll hear something similar.  Even very senior, very experienced (very white,
very male) developers have a lot of frustration trying to convince others that their ideas have value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just a Problem With Women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering if our problem is that we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt;.  When it comes to exchanging
technical ideas, I think overall we&amp;rsquo;re not good at really listening to each other.  At the very least,
I think we&amp;rsquo;re bad at making people feel heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think about this for a bit. If we don&amp;rsquo;t listen to developers, if we don&amp;rsquo;t help them to understand why they&amp;rsquo;re wrong,
or work together to incorporate all ideas into a super-idea that&amp;rsquo;s the best solution, developers will become frustrated.  We&amp;rsquo;re
knowledge workers, what we bring to the table is our brains, our ideas, our solutions.  If these are persistently not valued,
we could go one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it our way anyway. We still think we&amp;rsquo;re right, we haven&amp;rsquo;t been convinced that our idea is not correct,
or that someone else&amp;rsquo;s is correct (maybe because we didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to them? Maybe because no-one took the time to listen to us and
explain why we were wrong? Maybe because we &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; right and no-one was listening?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave. We might join a team where we feel more valued, or we might leave development all together.  At least as a business analyst,
as a project manager, as a tester, people &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to listen to us: by their very definition the output of those jobs is an input to the
development team (and other teams).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option one leads to rogue code in our application, often not checked by anyone else in the team let alone understood by them,
because of course we were not &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to implement this.  So it&amp;rsquo;s done in secret.  If it works, at worst
no-one notices.  And at best? You&amp;rsquo;re held up as a hero for actually Getting Something Done. This can&amp;rsquo;t be right,
we&amp;rsquo;re rewarding the rebel behaviour, not encouraging honest discussion and making people feel included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option two, of course, leads to the team losing a developer. Sometimes you might argue &amp;ldquo;Good Riddance&amp;rdquo;.  But there&amp;rsquo;s such a skills
shortage, it&amp;rsquo;s so hard (and expensive) to hire developers, and you must have seen something in that developer to hire them in the first
place, that surely it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper, better, to make them feel welcome, wanted, valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do to listen to each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrospectives. Done right, these give the team a safe place to discuss things, to ask questions,
to suggest improvements.  It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a place to talk about code or design, but it is a good place to raise issues like the
ones above, and to suggest ways to address these problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could schedule sessions for sharing technical ideas: maybe regular brown bags to help people understand the technologies or
existing designs; maybe sessions where the architecture or design or principals of a particular area are explored and explained;
maybe sessions for those who feel unheard to explain in more detail where they&amp;rsquo;re coming from, principals that are important to them.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s important that these sessions are developer-lead, so that everyone has an opportunity to share their ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair programming. When you&amp;rsquo;re sat together, working together, there&amp;rsquo;s a flow of ideas, information, designs,
experience. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a case of a more senior person mentoring a less experienced developer,
all of us have different skills and value different qualities in our implementation - one of you could be obsessive about the tests,
where the other really cares about readability of the code (for example). When you implement something in a pair,
you feel ownership of that code, but you feel less personally attached to the code - you created it,
but you created it from the best of both of you, you had to listen to each other to come to a conclusion and implement it. And if an
even better idea comes along, great, it just improves the code. And you&amp;rsquo;re constantly learning from the other people you work with,
and can see the effect of them learning from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should value, and coach, more skills than simply technology skills. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why we still seem to have this idea that developers
are just
typists communing with the computer - the best developers work well in teams and communicate well with the business and users,&lt;br /&gt;
the best leaders make everyone in their team more productive.  Sales guys are trained in skills like active listening,
like communication skills.  More development teams should focus on improving communication skills as a productivity tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; more options, I just thought of these in ten minutes.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you read any books aimed at business people,
or at growing your career,
there are loads of tried and tested methods for making people feel heard, for playing nicely with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we should work harder to listen to each other. Next time you&amp;rsquo;re discussing something with your team, or with your boss,
try and listen to what they&amp;rsquo;re saying - ask them to clarify things you don&amp;rsquo;t understand (you won&amp;rsquo;t look stupid, and
developers &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; explaining things), and repeat back what you do understand. Request the same respect in return - if you feel your ideas
aren&amp;rsquo;t being heard, make sure you sit down with someone to talk over your ideas or your doubts in more detail,
and be firm in making sure the team or that person is hearing what you think you&amp;rsquo;re saying.  We may be wrong, they may be right,
but we need to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re wrong, or we&amp;rsquo;ll never learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we all start listening a bit more, maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll be a bit happier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s not waste, it&#39;s learning</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/its_not_waste_its_learning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/its_not_waste_its_learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one my my rare weekends at home, I found myself on a pottery course (this is the sort of thing that happens when you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; title=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time on the course, there was something enormously satisfactory and therapeutic about working with my hands,
on something creative that was for me, and only me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My first bowl&#34; title=&#34;My first bowl&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Honestly, I think the one I did in primary school when I was seven was better.&lt;br /&gt;
And I don&amp;rsquo;t care, because I loved creating it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really struck me that day was embracing failure and destruction as part of the creative process.  Let me give you a
couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher showed us several techniques for creating pottery, one of which was using plaster moulds and very liquid clay to produce more
complex items (for example, mugs and animal figures).  He told us that when using a new mould,
the first few items would be useless.  But these &amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo; are an important process for the mould itself.  The
class was in Spanish, so my understanding was imperfect, but I think it was something to do with the fact that the plaster moulds are
supposed to absorb water, and therefore I assume at the beginning they absorb far too much and the clay ends up being too dry and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; title=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;Pottery created with moulds&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example was when he showed us why it was so difficult to create a clay plate - bowls, mugs, cups were fine,
but a plate is difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s flat and the shape doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough structure for it to have any rigidity  if it&amp;rsquo;s even slightly damp
(and clay stays damp for a looong time, even in a climate like Seville&amp;rsquo;s). He demonstrated this by cutting straight through the plate
that he&amp;rsquo;d put into the mould earlier and folding it up, to the collective intake of breath of the whole class - a class of people of a range
of ages and backgrounds. We seem socially programmed to find destruction of any kind upsetting (which is probably, overall,
not a bad thing), when the teacher sliced the plate in half to demonstrate how floppy the plate was, we were all disturbed by this waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My pieces&#34; title=&#34;My pieces&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Even when I broke my bowl when preparing it for the kiln, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to abandon it - I turned it into a
candle holder&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing - it&amp;rsquo;s clay.  Clay is mud.  It&amp;rsquo;s from the ground.  Moreover, it&amp;rsquo;s almost completely reusable.  All of the leftover
clay from our earlier exercises, all of the excess liquid clay from the moulds, all of the pieces that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it,
it was put aside and saved for later.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a waste.  It&amp;rsquo;s learning.  It&amp;rsquo;s experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking.  If we can be like that about something concrete, something that exists in the real world,
why aren&amp;rsquo;t we like that about something as ephemeral as code?  Why are we so afraid to throw away code? And don&amp;rsquo;t tell me we&amp;rsquo;re not
afraid - how many &amp;ldquo;spikes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prototypes&amp;rdquo; have you seen running in production?  Have you read people talking about
creating code and throwing it away, and thought &amp;ldquo;that sounds nice, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to just producing useful code&amp;rdquo;? (Note: I&amp;rsquo;m not
talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&#34;&gt;throwing away perfectly good production code&lt;/a&gt;,
nor am I talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://codesqueeze.com/refactorbation/&#34;&gt;refactorbation&lt;/a&gt;, a term I just discovered and love.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating for research, spikes, learning etc, and then throwing it away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Java&#34; title=&#34;Java&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;What?? I needed to carve something into the medallion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477800670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1477800670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=5KXFITDLKQQCXD3K&#34;&gt;Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1477800670&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;,
and there&amp;rsquo;s a section in there that talks about getting into the habit of
creating just for the sake of creating.  Not for your side projects, not for a client, not even for your portfolio.  Simply to get into
the habit of creating.  &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; some of those ideas, or processes, will come in handy later down the line.  Or maybe,
like the clay moulds, simply creating something for throwing away actually helps the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiences have left me with a feeling that I should start getting used to the idea of throwing code away,
and start creating things for no reason other than the feeling of creating.  It could be like running - in theory I run so I have to
worry less about my weight and my fitness, but actually I run &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more frequently when I run just for the joy of running. The fitness
and health are side benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re so reluctant to throw code away precisely because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ephemeral.  Maybe with the clay,
we can see that concrete thing, that mud, being turned into something useful eventually.  With running,
you can feel the difference in your attitude, in your fitness, maybe see it on the scales. With code, when you delete those characters,
revert that change, you feel like you lost something, and have nothing to show for that precious time.  When actually you created new
pathways in your brain, added new memories and learnt new lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready yet to create just for the sake of creating, I think I&amp;rsquo;m just too results-driven. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to
write about it here to remind myself that it is something I want to do. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the exercise, not the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The final pieces, still needing the kiln to finish the glaze.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crowd Sourced Testing - Be an early adopter</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/strong&gt;
Please try out the (unfinished, unreleased) snapshot version of the 3.x MongoDB Java Driver in your continuous integration environment and
e-mail me with any errors or unexpected behaviour (or ideally positive feedback) you have, and we&amp;rsquo;ll give you goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it feels like a long time ago that I wrote about the
&lt;a href=&#34;post/the_30_java_driver__design_goals/&#34;&gt;Design Goals for the new MongoDB Java Driver&lt;/a&gt;, and gave some pointers on
&lt;a href=&#34;post/how_to_get_started_with_the_new_mongodb_java_driver/&#34;&gt;How to get started&lt;/a&gt;.  Not surprisingly, things have moved on since then,
and we&amp;rsquo;re ready for very early adopters to start trying out the new driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using the Java Driver, and you have a continuous integration environment where you&amp;rsquo;re running a bunch of automated tests (and
we&amp;rsquo;re all doing that, right?), then you have the opportunity to &lt;strike&gt;find our first bugs&lt;/strike&gt; provide us with valuable feedback,
before we release the final version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new driver will have an updated API, we also aim to preserve backwards compatibility with the existing API.  However,
we have been deprecating classes and methods in the 2.12 and 2.13 &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/releases&#34;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; of
the driver, and many of these classes and methods will be removed in 3.0
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/3.0.x/config/clirr-exclude.yml#L11&#34;&gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;).  If you&amp;rsquo;re running a 2.12.x
release without deprecation warnings, you should be able to drop in the new driver and run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using Maven or Gradle, it should be super easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/6183621.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Gradle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/6183766.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Old School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the latest jar from &lt;code&gt;3.0.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/&#34;&gt;https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please try out the updated Java driver, with the &amp;ldquo;compatible&amp;rdquo; API, and e-mail me (trisha.gee at mongodb.com) with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Required) The date you downloaded the driver to test (since the snapshot will be changing daily)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Any bugs you&amp;rsquo;ve found&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Any unexpected changes in behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Feedback on the performance (if you have performance tests for example) - whether the performance is better or worse, we want to hear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Positive feedback (always welcome!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For bugs, either raise a &lt;a href=&#34;http://jira.mongodb.org&#34;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt; ticket, or get me to raise one for you, for you so you can track the status of the
bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the carrot: if you give us feedback, we&amp;rsquo;ll do something nice for you - either send you swag,
or promote your team/company/self on our blog or readme or somewhere equally public.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/presentation/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/presentation/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I gave a keynote at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to address the problems
of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not by putting it into production).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41120693&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;355&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;During the talk I show an example of how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/a3e4a54329e94ada2fe2&#34;&gt;implement lambdas&lt;/a&gt;,
and I also demonstrate a very crude performance test for using &lt;code&gt;parallelStream&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to link to the performance test as it&amp;rsquo;s
not a shining example of how to write these sorts of tests, but if you&amp;rsquo;re desperate you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find it in my Github repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also talk about how amazing Spock is, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested you can read more about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/tags/spock/&#34;&gt;my experiences with Spock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was built off an &lt;a href=&#34;/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/&#34;&gt;earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, about how to decide which technologies to
invest your personal time in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation was videoed, and if the video comes online I will post it here. But for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this crude decision
chart and the mind-map of potential ways to play with a technology. Remember, learning to say &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; to a technology can be very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/staying-ahead/why-learn.png&#34; alt=&#34;Decision Flow Diagram&#34; title=&#34;Decision Flow Diagram&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/staying-ahead/approaches.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Approaches to trying new technologies&#34; title=&#34;Approaches to trying new technologies&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of writing a book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/careeradviceforprogrammers/&#34;&gt;Career Advice for Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re
interested, let me know (because, you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve got loads of spare time for another project, sigh&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Presentation Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all want to stay ahead of the curve - after all, that&amp;rsquo;s what you go to a conference for. But have you ever considered how being ahead
of the curve might be dangerous?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using a new language before you understand it, putting a technology into production so you can learn it,
abandoning &amp;ldquo;old practices&amp;rdquo; before you&amp;rsquo;ve got the benefit from them… These things are common practice,
under the guise of Progress and Keeping Up To Date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But while we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be running around like headless chickens chasing the next Shiny New Thing,
we do need to see to our Continuous Learning and, of course, we should Embrace Change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we balance these two extremes? And how do we see to our own growth and learning as techies while meeting the needs of our
project, team and organisation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
