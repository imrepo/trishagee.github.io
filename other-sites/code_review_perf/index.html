  <h1 itemprop="name" id="title">Performance</h1>
  <div>
        <article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
           

<p>In part three of our series on code reviews, we&rsquo;re going to look at what you can look for in terms of the performance
of the code under review.</p>

<p>As with all architecture/design areas, the non-functional requirements for the performance of a system should have
been set up-front. Whether you&rsquo;re working on a low-latency trading system which has to respond in nano-seconds,
are creating an online shopping site where you have to provide responsiveness for the user, or are writing a phone
app to manage a TODO list, you should have some idea about what&rsquo;s considered &ldquo;too slow&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s cover some of the areas that a reviewer can look for during a code review.</p>

<h3 id="firstly:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">Firstly</h3>

<p><strong>Did this piece of functionality have hard performance requirements?</strong><br />
Does the piece of code under review fall under an area that had a previously published SLA? Or do the requirements
state the performance characteristics required?</p>

<p>If the original requirements were a bug along the lines of &ldquo;the login screen is too slow to load&rdquo;, the original
developer should have clarified what would be a suitable loading time  - otherwise how can the reviewer or the author
be confident that the speed has been sufficiently improved?</p>

<p><strong>If so, is there a test that proves it meets those?</strong><br />
Any performance critical system should have automated performance tests which ensure that published SLAs
(“all order requests serviced in less than 10ms”) are met. Without these, you&rsquo;re relying on your users to inform you
of failures to meet your SLAs. Not only is this a poor user experience, but could lead to avoidable fines and fees.
The
<a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2015/08/03/what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review-tests/">last post</a> in this series
covered code-reviewing tests in a lot of details.</p>

<p><strong>Has the fix/new functionality negatively impacted the results of any existing performance tests?</strong><br />
If you are regularly running performance tests (or if you have a suite that can be run on demand), check that new
code in performance-critical areas hasn&rsquo;t introduced a decrease in system performance.</p>

<p><strong>If you don&rsquo;t have hard performance requirements for this code review?</strong><br />
There&rsquo;s limited value spending hours agonising over optimisations that will save you a few CPU cycles. But there are
things a reviewer can check for in order to ensure that the code doesn&rsquo;t suffer from common performance pitfalls
that are completely avoidable. Check out the rest of the list to see if there are easy wins to prevent future
performance problems.</p>

<h3 id="calls-outside-of-the-service-application-are-expensive:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">Calls outside of the service/application are expensive</h3>

<p>Any use of systems outside your own application that require a network hop are generally going to cost you <em>much</em> more
than a poorly optimised <code>equals()</code> method. Consider:</p>

<p><strong>Calls to the database</strong><br />
The worst offenders might be hiding behind abstractions like ORMs. But in a code review you should be able to
catch common causes of performance problems, like individual calls to a database inside a loop - for example, loading
a list of IDs, then querying the database for each individual item that corresponds to that ID.</p>

<p><strong>Unnecessary network calls</strong><br />
Like databases, remote services can sometimes be over-used, with multiple remote calls being made where a single one
might suffice, or where batching or caching might prevent expensive network calls. Again, like databases, sometimes an
abstraction can hide that a method call is actually calling a remote API.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile / wearable apps calling the back end too much</strong><br />
This is basically the same as &ldquo;unnecessary network calls&rdquo;, but with the added problem that on mobile devices, not
only will unnecessary calls to the back-end cost you performance, it will also cost you battery life.</p>

<h3 id="using-resources-efficiently-effectively:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">Using resources efficiently/effectively</h3>

<p>Following on from how we use our network resources, a reviewer can look at the use of other resources to identify
possible performance problems.</p>

<p><strong>Does the code use locks to access shared resources? Could this result in poor performance or deadlocks?</strong><br />
<a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com.es/2013/08/lock-based-vs-lock-free-concurrent.html">Locks are a performance killer</a>
and very hard to reason about in a multi-threaded environment. Consider patterns like; having only a single thread that
writes/changes values while all other threads are free to read; or using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm">lock free algorithms</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is there something in the code which could lead to a memory leak?</strong><br />
In Java / JVM languages, some common causes can be: mutable static fields; using ThreadLocal; using classloaders;</p>

<p><strong>Is there a possibility the memory footprint of the application could grow infinitely?</strong><br />
This is not the same as a memory leak - a memory leak is where unused objects cannot be collected by the garbage
collector.  But any language, even non-garbage-collected ones, can create data structures that grow indefinitely. If,
as a reviewer, you see new values constantly being added to a list or map, question if and when the list or map is
discarded or trimmed.</p>

<p><strong>Does the code close connections/streams?</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s easy to forget to close connections or file/network streams.  When you&rsquo;re
reviewing someone else&rsquo;s code, whichever language it happens to be in, if a file, network or database connection is
in use, make sure it is correctly closed. In Java 7, this has become much easier to manage thanks to
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html">try-with-resources</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Are resource pools correctly configured?</strong><br />
The optimal configuration for an environment is going to depend on a number of factors, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that as a
reviewer you&rsquo;ll know immediately if, for example, a database connection pool is correctly sized. But there are a few
things you can tell at a glance, for example is the pool too small (e.g. sized at one) or too big (millions of
threads). Fine tuning these values requires testing in an environment as close to the real environment as possible,
but a common problem that can be identified at code review is when a pool (thread pool or connection pool) is really
far too large.  Logic dictates that larger is better, but of course each of these objects takes up resources, and the
overhead of managing thousands of them is usually much higher than the benefits of having many of them available. If
in doubt, the defaults are usually a good start. Code that deviates from default settings should prove the value with
some sort of test or calculation.</p>

<h3 id="warning-signs-not-to-be-ignored-by-a-reviewer:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">Warning signs not to be ignored by a reviewer</h3>

<p>Some types of code suggests immediately a potential performance problem. This will depend upon the language and
libraries used (please let us know in the comments of &ldquo;code smells&rdquo; in your environment).</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong><br />
Reflection in Java is
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html">slower than doing things without reflection</a>. If you&rsquo;re
reviewing code that contains reflection, question whether this is absolutely required.</p>

<p><strong>Timeouts</strong><br />
When you&rsquo;re reviewing code, you might not know what the correct timeout for
an operation is, but you should be thinking &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the impact on the rest of the system while this timeout is
ticking down?&ldquo;. As the reviewer you should consider the worst case - is the application blocking while a 5 minute
timeout is
ticking down? What&rsquo;s the worst that would happen if this was set to one second? If the author of the code can&rsquo;t
justify the length of a timeout, and you, the reviewer, don&rsquo;t know the pros and cons of a selected value, then it
might be a good time to get someone involved who does understand the implications.</p>

<p><strong>Parallelism</strong><br />
Does the code use multiple threads to perform a simple operation might add more time and complexity than savings in
time? With modern Java, this might be more subtle than creating new threads explicitly: does the code use Java 8&rsquo;s
shiny new parallel streams but not benefit from the parallelism? For example, using a
parallel stream on a small number of elements, or on a stream which does very simple operations, might cost more time
than performing the operations on a sequential stream.</p>

<h3 id="correctness:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">Correctness</h3>

<p>These things are not necessarily going to impact the performance of your system, but since they&rsquo;re largely related to
running in a multi-threaded environment, they are related to the topic:</p>

<p><strong>Is the code using the correct data structure for a multi-threaded environment?</strong><br />
i.e a threadsafe one</p>

<p><strong>Is the code susceptible to race conditions?</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to write code that can cause subtle race conditions when used in a multi-threaded environment.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>public void incrementX() {
    someObject.setX(someObject.getX() + 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Although this code is on a single line, it&rsquo;s possible for another thread to increment the value of <code>x</code> between this
code getting it, and this code setting the new value. As a reviewer, look out for <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> combos that are not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability">atomic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is the code using locks correctly?</strong><br />
Related to race conditions, as a reviewer you should be checking that the code being reviewed is not allowing
multiple threads to modify values in a way that could clash. The code might need
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/locksync.html">synchronization</a>,
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html">locks</a>,
or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/atomicvars.html">atomic variables</a> to control
changes to blocks of code.</p>

<p><strong>Is the performance test for the code valuable?</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s easy to write <a href="http://www.developertutorials.com/anatomy-flawed-microbenchmark-050426/">poor microbenchmarks</a>,
for example, or to use data that&rsquo;s not at all like production data.</p>

<p><strong>Caching</strong><br />
While caching might be a way to prevent making too many external requests, it comes with its own challenges.
If the code under review uses caching, you
should look for some common problems, for example, incorrect invalidation of cache items.</p>

<h3 id="code-level-optimisations:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">Code-level optimisations</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reviewing code, and you&rsquo;re a developer, this following section may have optimisations you&rsquo;d love
to suggest. As a team, you need to know up-front just how important performance is to
you, and whether these sorts of optimisations are beneficial to your code.</p>

<p>For most organisations that aren&rsquo;t building a low-latency application, these optimisations are probably fall under
the category of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization">premature optimizations</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the code use synchronization/locks when they&rsquo;re not required?
if the code is always run on a single thread, locks are unnecessary overhead</li>
<li>Is the code using a safe data structure with locks where it&rsquo;s not required?
e.g. can <code>Vector</code> be replaced with <code>ArrayList</code>?</li>
<li>Is the code using a data structure with poor performance for my common operations?
For example, using a linked list but needing to regularly search for a single item in it.</li>
<li>Is the code using locks or synchronization when it could use atomic variables instead?</li>
<li>Is there a lot of string formatting? Could this be more efficient?</li>

<li><p>Are the logging statements using string formatting? Are they either protected by an <code>if</code> to check logging
level, or using a supplier which is evaluated lazily?<br />
For example</p>

<pre><code>if (LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
    LOGGER.debug(format(&quot;Connected to %s&quot;, server.getAddress()));
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>will mean that the String formatting is only performed if the logger is set to debug level. Without the <code>if</code>, the
expensive formatting operation is performed even when the statement is not printed to the log.</p>

<ul>
<li>Could the code benefit from lazy loading?</li>
<li>Can <code>if</code> statements or other logic be short-circuited by placing the fastest evaluation first?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="that-s-a-lot-of-things-to-worry-about-when-it-comes-to-performance:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">That&rsquo;s a lot of things to worry about when it comes to performance&hellip;.</h3>

<p>As with my <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2015/07/23/what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review/">original list</a> of
things to look for in code review, this article highlights some areas that your team
<em>might</em> want to consistently check for during reviews. This will depend a lot upon the performance requirements for
your project.</p>

<p>Although this article is aimed at all developers, many of the examples are Java / JVM specific. I&rsquo;d like to finish
with some easy things for reviewers of Java code to look for, that will give the the JVM a good chance of optimising
your code so that you don&rsquo;t have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write small methods and classes</li>
<li>Keep the logic simple - no deeply nested <code>ifs</code> or loops</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, the more readable the code is to a human, the more chance the
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/architect-evans-pt1-2266278.html">JIT compiler</a> has of
understanding your code enough to optimise it. This should be easy to spot during code review - if the code looks
understandable and clean, it&rsquo;s got a good chance of also performing well.</p>

<h3 id="in-summary:0d3b68f8e194c7580b67fef999b37316">In Summary</h3>

<p>When it comes to performance, understand that there are some areas that you may be able to get quick wins in (for
example, unnecessary calls to a database) that can be identified during code review, and some areas that will be
tempting to comment on but might not gain enough value for the needs of your system.</p>
