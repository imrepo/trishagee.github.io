    Wow. My 4th QCon London.&nbsp; That’s not bad.&nbsp; And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for&nbsp;2013,&nbsp;2012, and even 2007 (part 1 &amp; part 2 - how cute was I? &ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&rdquo;)).I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?) minute and do a live coding session, something much more technical than my recent talks.&nbsp; I’ll leave the details for a separate blog post though, when the video comes out.The thing that stands out for me from Wednesday though was Damian Conway programming Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life in Klingon.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Just find the video and watch it, the man is a genius.The Thursday keynote was inspiring too from a totally different point of view - Tim Lister of Peopleware fame shared stories from his career, and I came away from that really happy I work as a technologist, but with an increased desire to learn off other amazing people.On Thursday I hosted the&nbsp;&ldquo;Not Only Java&ldquo;&nbsp;track - I’m on the programme committee for QCon, and this year we wanted to cover&nbsp;leading edge technologies (as always) but we didn’t want to slice things into strict technology silos [interruption: argh!

    I’ve been running into BSkyB a bunch this week - firstly I was invited to kick off their innovation tech talks series last Monday, then I kept meeting Sky people (that makes it sound like they’re aliens) at QCon.It seems Sky is keen to create/foster a culture of innovation, which is an ambitious goal for such a large company.&nbsp; So I was given a very vague brief for Monday’s presentation (“Can you do something Mongo-ish, maybe a bit of performance and concurrency stuff, and talk about overall best practice?”) I gave them an early view of a presentation I’m working on titled something like “Why do we keep reinventing the wheel?” (anyone who saw me at JFokus might realise that I cunningly swapped out most of the body of the “What do you mean, backwards compatibility?” talk and tried out this topic instead).Picture courtesy of&nbsp;+Russell Miles&nbsp;This was supposed to be a 20 minute intro talk (OK, so I clocked it at 40 minutes in rehearsal) with the rest of the time devoted to questions on any subject I know about, or even anything I have an opinion on.&nbsp; Sounds dangerous, but means I can always move fast on the answers I don’t know in order to cover more ground - cunning, you see?&nbsp; Actually, that sounds like it would be more fun if alcohol were involved.Anyway.&nbsp; The talk bit of the session took up most of the time, because I had really good questions during the course of the presentation.&nbsp; It’s nice to talk to a much smaller group (there were maybe 30ish people, giving up their free time after work, like an internal user group).&nbsp; But I also had questions on remote working, on creating a culture that’s appealing for developers to come and work in, and on MongoDB.I don’t know how many companies do things like this, or lunchtime brown bags, or something, but I think they’re a great idea.&nbsp; This was a mix of people from different departments, different teams, working on different technologies.&nbsp; It was a good way to get people from across the organisation talking with each other and sharing best practice between teams.&nbsp; Many organisations have people working in their little silo, and we (MongoDB) often find ourselves introducing teams from within the same organisation to each other - there’s no other mechanism for one team to find out about the other.&nbsp; I guess that’s what white-tower architects were supposed to be for - to know what everyone’s up to and make sure people are doing the “right” thing.&nbsp; Given this doesn’t seem to work, what else can we do to share knowledge internally?&nbsp; How else can we get the right people to meet each other?

    Dick Wall -&nbsp;The Tao, of the Joy, of CodingI’m on a plane (there’s a surprise) on my way back from The Joy of Coding.&nbsp; It’s the title that attracted me to this conference, and it was a great little one day event with awesome people like Dan North, Erik Meijer and Dick Wall presenting.&nbsp; What I liked about the themes is they were broadly technology agnostic, pulling back to a level which made me remember why I’m a developer.

    Web development has changed a lot.I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer. &nbsp;Sort of.

    So, following on from my observations of being an outsider at FOSDEM because I&rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.I&rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.At JFokus (a conference I really enjoyed, where I got a chance to spend time with some awesome people) I was on a panel (well, game-show really) about static vs dynamic languages.

    So, FOSDEM.I've heard great things about this conference, so I was pretty exited to goThe Java dev roomNow I know people talk about impostor syndrome whenever they mention the woeful lack of diversity at tech conferences.&nbsp; Interestingly, I felt like an impostor at FOSDEM - not because I'm a woman (there were quite a few techy women around at FOSDEM, more than I expected) but because I'm not an open source person.I mean, I am, technically - MongoDB and the Java driver are both open source, and I have real live code on github.&nbsp; But I didn't get there via the open source community, I was hired to do a specific job that happens to be open source (for which I am extremely grateful).&nbsp; So although I knew the MongoDB folks I was there with and a lot of people who were running or speaking in the Java room, I didn't feel really at home in this conference.&nbsp; I think I feel more comfortable with the ones aimed at enterprise Java developers (by which I mean Java people who work producing software for companies) because this is more similar to my background - I understand the attendees and I think I know what they want.It's also possible since I've been to a lot more of the enterprise-aimed conferences that I used to feel just as awkward there, and I've become much more comfortable now I've been to many.Which leads me to another observation: when I first went to JavaOne, in 2011, I felt extremely conspicuous as a woman.&nbsp; I mean, I didn't do much to help, my skirts and shorts are occasionally… not really enterprise-developer-length.&nbsp; But I felt like everyone noticed me and I felt the pressure to assert early on in every new conversation that I was, in fact, a developer and not a booth babe or a recruiter.&nbsp; But these days, I feel much more comfortable.&nbsp; And do you know what's really helped with that?&nbsp; Being a speaker; having my face on the website.&nbsp; I don't have to prove I'm a developer, I was asked to speak at that conference - if the conference organisers think I belong there, then I belong there.So… what.Well, we can do things to combat this I-don't-belong-here feeling -&nbsp;I'm pretty sure we've all been there, regardless of gender, race, background etc.

    Last night was the inaugural meeting of the Sevilla MongoDN User Group. &nbsp;An event organised with just over 48 hours notice, in a city where I don&rsquo;t speak the language and where even my best-connected contacts aren&rsquo;t sure they&rsquo;re fully plugged in to the tech scene.I&rsquo;ll admit, I had some reservations:a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I&rsquo;m desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I&rsquo;m just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?

    I&rsquo;m pleased to see that GM has hired the &ldquo;best person for the job&rdquo; as their new CEO&nbsp;- that does seem like a good idea. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m happy her gender did not get in the way. &nbsp;What makes me uncomfortable is the international news coverage of the decision of this large manufacturer to hire a woman as their CEO - if she were a man (and/or black/gay/disabled) would the headline read &ldquo;The camera loves her.

    Well, if I thought 2012 was the fastest disappearing year on record, that record was smashed into the ground by 2013. &nbsp;What a year! &nbsp;And because I didn&rsquo;t manage to write this on time to publish elsewhere, I can do a more personal reflection of the year here on my very own blog.Apparently, reading over last year&rsquo;s article, I had goals for 2013:Get more involved in schools/mentoring. Yeah&hellip; That didn&rsquo;t happen.
