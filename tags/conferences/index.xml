      <title>Blind CFPs - a Postscript</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since publishing &lt;a href=&#34;/post/blind_cfps&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great comments, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write yet
another post to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me state that I don&amp;rsquo;t think blind CFPs are a complete waste of time - for example, I know that there are
circles in which speakers will refuse to submit if the selection process isn&amp;rsquo;t blind. But what blind CFPs are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;,
is an answer to &amp;ldquo;How do I get more women speakers at my conference?&amp;rdquo;, especially if the problem is not that the
women are being rejected, but that they simply aren&amp;rsquo;t submitting talks - this is the situation I see most frequently
in the conferences I speak at/help organise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re missing the point of blind CFPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to address the point &amp;ldquo;Blind CFPs are to protect the organisers, not simply to improve diversity&amp;rdquo;. OK, great. So
in the case of the conferences that had only two women out of 200 submissions: if you make that process blind, whether you
select both women or not, when there are nasty comments about your lack of women speakers, you&amp;rsquo;re protected - you did
the right things, you had a blind CFP, and just not many women made it through that process. Women simply aren&amp;rsquo;t
writing compelling abstracts and/or aren&amp;rsquo;t picking interesting subjects and/or clearly aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in
presenting at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAAARRRGGHHHHHH!!!! Anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protect your arse if you like, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, I see the attacks against organisers and I understand the need to be able to
say you did the right thing. But notice that once you&amp;rsquo;ve protected yourselves, the blame is back on the
minorities for not meeting your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a blind CFP is to protect the selectors, then let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend it&amp;rsquo;s an answer to increasing diversity
of speakers, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece in a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;An abstract is not a representation of your talk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can emphasise this enough: blind CFPs have a very big weakness - there is no direct correlation between
a good abstract and a good talk. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a bunch of talks online lately, and I watched one with an abstract
that absolutely called to me - here was the missing piece for a technology that I simply can&amp;rsquo;t get my head around. I
gave an hour of my life to that talk, each minute I was wondering when this person would get to the bits mentioned
in the abstract, so I watched it all the way to the end. They never delivered what the abstract promised, and their
meandering style meant I learnt almost nothing from the talk. That&amp;rsquo;s an hour of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back. Good
thing I was playing computer games as well at the time, if I&amp;rsquo;d paid money for that I would have been very peeved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another weakness in this process - if you go to a number of conferences (like I do) you kinda learn which
speakers are doing
which talks.  If I submit my &amp;ldquo;AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong??&amp;rdquo;
talk to a blind process, if there&amp;rsquo;s anyone on the selection committee who&amp;rsquo;s even vaguely involved in the Java or MongoDB
spaces, they&amp;rsquo;ll know that&amp;rsquo;s me. And they can Google the talk and decide whether they like it (or with any luck, the
buzz-word crammed title will do the job and they&amp;rsquo;ll say yes, although probably AngularJS is so 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abstract is like your presentation in the same way that your CV is like your ability to do your job - there&amp;rsquo;s a skill
to writing good abstracts (or CVs), but mastery of that skill does not necessarily mean mastery of the thing it
represents - the ability to present or the ability to do the job.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be sold on a blind process
being a good way to build &amp;ldquo;the best content available for the conference&amp;rdquo; until this disconnect is somehow solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;For goodness sake Trisha, the postscript is nearly longer than the original post&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to feedback from a bunch of people, and I have learnt more things (thanks everyone!). I am more sold on
a blind CFP being maybe part of a bigger process. But I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe it fixes the &amp;ldquo;we need more women speakers&amp;rdquo;
problem, which was the original claim that I wanted to dispute. Conferences have to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more active to address
this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am not sold on an abstract being a fair representation of the quality of a talk. Maybe a more realistic &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo;
audition would be to give the talk to an audience, like a user group, who rated the talk:
the organisers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t watch the talk, but they could use the ratings to decide. Yes, the user group could also
have biases that affect their rating, but when the speaker gives the talk at the conference, those attendees will also
have their biases too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blindness is not a realistic option, we just have to keep putting women (and other non-white-straight-men) in front of
audiences until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Speaker Diversity</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically,
although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem,
only identify some issues and explore some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&amp;rsquo;t post it now I&amp;rsquo;ll never post it, and it&amp;rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and
posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Firstly, what stops people from stepping up to speak?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the very first thing any developer says when you ask them why they haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about presenting at conferences or user
groups. Turns out, you always have something to say.  For example, our most popular sessions at the Sevilla JUG and MUG are &amp;ldquo;Introduction
 to&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;. You hear from plenty of experts who have travelled the whole road to some pinnacle of excellence,
 but what many developers need is simply someone a couple of steps ahead of them to lead them forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always know more than &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know everything, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know more than everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I be role model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So many women feel this, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely sympathetic to this view point: I&amp;rsquo;m a woman developer, getting along, happy in my job,
happy being a programmer, why the hell should I have to stand up and present and blog and be a role model for other women? Men don&amp;rsquo;t have
to do that. Men can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the fear that if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stand up, become a role model, that somehow people will think you&amp;rsquo;re representing all
women developers. You&amp;rsquo;ll be worried because you can only represent who you are, what you do, you can&amp;rsquo;t represent a whole gender in a
single presentation or a single interview.  And the pressure! What if I mess up? What if I say something my gender does not agree with?
What if I say something that causes my whole gender to be judged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally understandable fears. Totally true that many people will ask you to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; woman developer, to answer for all women.  Well,
that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking more women to stand up, to be role models - if we all step up, it will no longer just be me, and you,
and that other one over there. There&amp;rsquo;ll be more of us, more differing voices, we&amp;rsquo;ll stand out less. But we have to stand up first.  And
in the meantime it&amp;rsquo;s us and our points of view they&amp;rsquo;re listening to. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you rather voice your opinion than have someone else speak
on your behalf? Especially when very few people really can represent you, who you are and what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised at what you do know, so people who present run into this less than you&amp;rsquo;d think, even if you&amp;rsquo;re just beginning,
but just in case here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the question, paraphrasing. Firstly, this ensures you&amp;rsquo;ve actually heard the question correctly. Secondly,
it allows the whole audience to hear it, and thirdly, but most importantly, it buys you time to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest - say you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and move on. If you know somewhere that might have the answer,
point the person to that resource.  But a technical audience actually values the answer &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; more than you think. Especially
the person who asked the question, it makes them feel really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, but you think the audience might know, throw it back to them. Either to the person who asked the question,
if that feels appropriate (especially if this is one of those &amp;ldquo;look how smart I am&amp;rdquo; questions),
or to the audience as a whole. In conferences in particular, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance someone there knows the answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re genuinely terrified of all questions, say at the start of the presentation that you won&amp;rsquo;t take questions in the talk. Offer
an alternative, like via Twitter or e-mail, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;What can conference organisers do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically invite the people you want presenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t just wait for them to submit. If you want more women, more diversity, invite them. And invite them early&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your women presenters early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recognise that there are relatively few women presenters on &amp;ldquo;the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and understand that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants them to speak at their
conference. This rare breed, the female technical presenter, gets booked up &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; in advance.  They&amp;rsquo;re probably as in-demand as your
keynote speakers, and can probably devote less time to appearing at conferences than those who have made it to keynote-standard (I&amp;rsquo;m
making a sweeping generalisation that your techy women have day-jobs as developers and your keynote speakers are either professional
presenters or at least can argue presenting as a critical part of their job).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have a limited resource (experienced women presenters) that&amp;rsquo;s in high demand. You need to reach out directly to them,
invite them, and secure them well in advance of your conference.  Many big conferences, for example JavaOne and QCon,
will invite speakers six months in advance. If you give women speakers a month&amp;rsquo;s notice before your conference or event,
they simply are not going to have the space in their schedule at that late notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showcase your diversity on your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory&#34;&gt;microaggressions&lt;/a&gt;,
go and read what that means before you get any further.  There&amp;rsquo;s a very simple thing you
need to do with your website, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve opened for CFP or you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get attendees to register - make sure the photos on your
website show the type of diversity you want to encourage.  Only yesterday I was looking at the website of a big conference,
who I know for a fact are working &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to ensure diversity, not just with gender but race, age,
and where possible in less physically obvious dimensions. The conference is many months off, so the only photo they have on the website
is a background photo of the exhibition hall from some previous year, crammed full of attendees - white, male attendees,
as far as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to tell.  It&amp;rsquo;s extremely subtle. You might not even notice, as the photo is behind the headers and text of the
site. But I noticed. And you can be sure the subconscious of every person who went to the website to either submit a proposal for a
talk, or is considering asking their employer to pay for the registration, also noticed.  The conscious mind might be able to shrug it
off.  But the subconscious of a non-white and/or non-male person notices and plants the subtle seed
of &amp;ldquo;this conference is not for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, conference and event organisers - if you want more women applying to speak at your conference,
show more women on your website.  If you want a more diverse audience, show more diverse faces.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve invited your women presenters
early and secured them early, show their photos on the site - this sends a strong message to other women that their talk proposals will be
taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run warm up nights to try out new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know conference organisers get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of submissions, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which are going to be good speakers,
especially if they&amp;rsquo;re new speakers or don&amp;rsquo;t have a video.  If you&amp;rsquo;re genuine about improving the diversity of your speakers,
run free nights to a) promote your conference and b) try out new speakers.  Probably a good idea to have a new speaker and a known
speaker to attract the crowd and give newbies a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be so damn picky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New speakers need to be encouraged. Find a way to see their content without just discarding an unknown name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing speakers might not have the luxury of creating new content. Many conferences want genuine practitioners,
not just evangelists, but those people have day jobs and can&amp;rsquo;t be creating a new talk just for your conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave space for new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;and don&amp;rsquo;t just have 7 slots for a pro speaker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at your swag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not just guys t-shirts.  One conference gave out cupcakes for example. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just have to be handbags and high-heeled shoes,
just take a quick look and see if your swag is generally useful for techies, or if it leans towards men only. Men only swag (men&amp;rsquo;s
t-shirts, bottle openers, subtle things like that) subliminally says &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t belong here&amp;rdquo; to the women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t tell every individual why they were rejected, but you could look at all the rejected submissions and give broad indications of
the type of CFPs that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Maybe write a blog post explaining which sorts of talks didn&amp;rsquo;t make it and why.  This will help
speakers create content that better fits your conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be specific about what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have tracks you&amp;rsquo;re finding content for, put them on the website/CFP, so people know what the topics are. If you have an
idea that you want 30% beginner material and 30% very advanced, make that clear too. Especially if you want &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; beginner or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
advanced. People will submit more appropriate talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a beginner&amp;rsquo;s track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;not just for the speakers, for the content too. Beginner speakers may be more comfortable presenting &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; talks.&lt;br /&gt;
Having a beginners track, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for content or speakers, will make newbies feel more included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;What other things can we try?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User groups can grow talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice writing CFPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning talks, book club, different meetup styles (like fishbowl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run an open conference to encourage new speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s user groups are instrumental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So here&amp;rsquo;s something interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m sceptical of all-women user groups as I feel it separates us from the communities we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
contributing to. But women&amp;rsquo;s user groups can help us to integrate better.  For example, Duchess France helped and encouraged its members
to submit talks to Devoxx, gave feedback on CFPs before they were submitted, and provided a safe place for the women to practice
presenting beforehand.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing women&amp;rsquo;s user groups could be fantastic for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Advice for budding speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Do It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more you do it, the more comfortable you&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker, it can make you feel less of an impostor at a conference - you&amp;rsquo;re not just a woman developer, you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s afraid, it&amp;rsquo;s not just you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer wants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience is on your side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Small (user groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be technical. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be super smart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrapping is hard - you haven&amp;rsquo;t presented so you can&amp;rsquo;t get into conferences. Again, user groups can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair. Ask a more experienced presenter if you can co-present with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is perfectly acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate there is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more I could have covered, and many topics deserve more depth. But this is the brain dump from the Devoxx
session, and maybe one day things will be expanded into their own topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/mongodb_london/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/mongodb_london/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt;, 6th November, 50% off with discount code &lt;strong&gt;50Trisha&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt; is nearly upon us again,
and I&amp;rsquo;m dead disappointed I can&amp;rsquo;t make it this year (I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;keynoting at GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; instead,
which I&amp;rsquo;m terrified, I mean, excited, about). The last MongoDB London was really interesting for me - I was fairly new to the company,
I&amp;rsquo;d been here less than six months, and it was a really great way to go both broad and deep on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to find a blog post where I talked about my experiences, but it looks like I only wrote that In My Mind. In fact,
I only only wrote two whole lines of notes on the conference.  But 18 months later I clearly remember presentations from my colleagues
&lt;a href=&#34;http://rosslawley.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://derickrethans.nl/&#34;&gt;Derick&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the geo capabilities in MongoDB,
presentations which heavily influenced the &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving
recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember Eliot&amp;rsquo;s presentation - Eliot is one of those people who totally gets away with breaking the &amp;ldquo;speak in a measured,
clear fashion&amp;rdquo; presenters rule, he fires fascinating information at you at high speed and it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the compelling things
about his talks. If you ever get a chance to see him talk about the product, it&amp;rsquo;s totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the most awesome thing about the conference was the chance to meet, and talk to,
a bunch of different MongoDB people - there are the engineers who work on the product (like me and my colleagues);
the people leading the way with the technology, like Eliot; and finally, but for me most importantly,
you get to meet really interesting people who are using MongoDB in ways that you might not even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway the point of this sales pitch is, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using MongoDB already or you&amp;rsquo;re keen to find out about it,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt; is only going to take a day from your life,
and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a bunch of interesting things. And, with a Special Discount Code from me,
it&amp;rsquo;s only £45! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mongodb-london-2014-registration-13140209721&#34;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;strong&gt;50Trisha&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upcoming Events 2014</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I updated you on my travel plans, so now I&amp;rsquo;ve had some more conferences confirmed,
I thought I would pass the information on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really lucky to have been selected for some great conferences this year.  I was asked to do a few more,
and it was genuinely painful to say no to everything, but it seems the laws of space and time cannot be broken,
and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to select a tiny subset of all the places I&amp;rsquo;d like to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 May: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/presentation/HTML5,%20Angular.js,%20Groovy,%20Java,
%20MongoDB%20all%20together%20-%20what%20could%20possibly%20go%20wrong?&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;m giving the same live coding presentation from QCon London,
although knowing me I expect there will be some tweaks, changes, additions, and maybe improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22-23 May: In New York City, since I&amp;rsquo;m more or less in the area.  Gimme a shout if you want to meet for a drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25-28 May: &lt;a href=&#34;http://speakerconf.com/&#34;&gt;SpeakerConf&lt;/a&gt; Barcelona.  And while I&amp;rsquo;m in the area&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 May: Barcelona JUG - &amp;ldquo;HTML5, Angular.js, Groovy, Java, MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-5 June: New York City, probably (wait, am I going to be at home at all??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 July: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/35444&#34;&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; - live coding again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28 Sep - 2 Oct: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/speakers/index.html#gee&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; woohoo!  I love having this opportunity to visit San
Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of other events I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to work out the details for, but I think this is 2014 all booked up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. My 4th QCon London.&amp;nbsp; That’s not bad.&amp;nbsp; And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/qcon-day-one.html&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, and even 2007 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-initial-thoughts.html&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-todo-list-inspired-by-conference.html&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; - how cute was I? &amp;ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&amp;rdquo;)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?) minute and do a live coding session, something much more technical than my recent talks.&amp;nbsp; I’ll leave the details for a separate blog post though, when the video comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that stands out for me from Wednesday though was Damian Conway programming &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_Game_of_Life&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; in Klingon.&amp;nbsp; Yeah.&amp;nbsp; Just find the video and watch it, the man is a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12947751623/player/f7e8167be5&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The Thursday keynote was inspiring too from a totally different point of view - Tim Lister of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY5A8X2/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00DY5A8X2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Peopleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00DY5A8X2&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; fame shared stories from his career, and I came away from that really happy I work as a technologist, but with an increased desire to learn off other amazing people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12966704755/player/7193594b96&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;On Thursday I hosted the&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/sets/72157641948363514/with/12970259753/&#34;&gt;Not Only Java&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;nbsp;track - I’m on the programme committee for QCon, and this year we wanted to cover&amp;nbsp;leading edge technologies (as always) but we didn’t want to slice things into strict technology silos [interruption: argh! the person in front of me nearly destroyed my laptop by suddenly moving their chair back! Why do people bother in economy on a morning flight?]. &amp;nbsp;So I wanted the Java track to be more representative of what today’s Java programmers care about - for the programmers of course, but also because I know there are architects and team leads at QCon who might not realise how things have moved on with the language, and how much polyglot programming we do these days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com.es/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; kicked it off with a great history lesson on the progress (or occasionally,&amp;nbsp; lack of it) in Java.&amp;nbsp; He begged us to study and understand Set Theory, to use async design, to think of the users of our APIs, and, most of all, to design nice, clean code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Next up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EvaAndreasson&#34;&gt;Eva&lt;/a&gt; took us through the fundamentals of Garbage Collection - this might not seem like a cutting edge subject these days, but it’s one of the most misunderstood subjects for Java programmers.&amp;nbsp; Eva gave us a really great, understandable view of the different types of garbage collectors, how they work, and their pros and cons.&amp;nbsp; She left us with a call to arms to not simply let other people try and solve this problem, but to get stuck in and contribute ourselves, via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/&#34;&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12970531704/player/e2c2f63b43&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch was my nerve-wracking live coding session, putting together a full stack end-to-end web app using AngularJS, HTML5, Java and MongoDB.&amp;nbsp; It only went wrong twice, and people seemed to like it.&amp;nbsp; I’ll post the video in another blog post as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s publicly available. &amp;nbsp;Code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;available on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;We’ve been playing with the open spaces idea at QCon.&amp;nbsp; The Java one only had a few people in it, but that gave everyone a chance to speak at least.&amp;nbsp; We covered Java 8 (the Good and the Bad); other JVM languages; and UIs for Java (Javascript or GWT?).&amp;nbsp; And I plugged the work the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; does in London, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;After this &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodil.org/&#34;&gt;Bodil&lt;/a&gt; blew me away creating a My Little Pony game using &lt;a href=&#34;https://rx.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;RX&lt;/a&gt; in the browser.&amp;nbsp; ‘Nuff said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/speakjava&#34;&gt;Simon Ritter&lt;/a&gt; gave us a view of the Java 8&amp;nbsp; features most likely to impact the way Java developers think about software design - lambdas and streams.&amp;nbsp; I thought this was a really great introduction to the concepts if you haven’t seen them before, and with concrete examples that showed how we should be using them. &amp;nbsp;If you&amp;rsquo;re not already looking at lambdas and streams, you should be - even if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be using Java 8 yet, it&amp;rsquo;s worth getting a heads up on how it&amp;rsquo;s going to impact our programming style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’m very pleased with the way the Java track turned out on the day - every speaker was first class, a wide range of topics was covered, and I, for one, learnt something in every presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;To finish off the day, Emma Langman gave an awesome keynote about how people are the messy bit of your system, and how they’re never rational and you shouldn’t expect them to be.&amp;nbsp; I also highly recommend this talk, especially if you’re a techy and you’ve found yourself in some sort of management or team lead position.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Sadly I couldn’t stay for day three of the conference, I had to fly off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/the-joy-of-coding.html&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt; to re-give the live coding presentation there.&amp;nbsp; Because, if you’re going to do something terrifying and doomed to failure, you might as well do it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QCon is an expensive conference, especially compared to the developer-friendly prices of something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.co.uk/&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;, but for getting a big picture of where the industry is, of things you might be missing, for learning hard core technical skills and understanding the important of the fluffy-people-stuff, and finally for meeting a wide range of people from developers to CTOs, I think you&amp;rsquo;d be hard pushed to find something better in London. &amp;nbsp;IMHO (and remember, I did disclose I&amp;rsquo;m on the programme committee). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although it&amp;rsquo;s really hard work putting together the programme for a track like this, and although both times I&amp;rsquo;ve said I&amp;rsquo;m Never Doing It Again, when it goes this well it makes you want to do it all over again. &amp;nbsp;After a break. &amp;nbsp;A looong break.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, following on from my observations of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2014/02/so-fosdem.html&#34;&gt;being an outsider&lt;/a&gt; at FOSDEM because I&amp;rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&amp;rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&amp;rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. &amp;nbsp;But I&amp;rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At JFokus (a conference I really enjoyed, where I got a chance to spend time with some awesome people) I was on a panel (well, game-show really) about static vs dynamic languages. &amp;nbsp;Not unusually, I was the only woman on the panel. &amp;nbsp;Also not unusually, one of the reasons I agreed to take part is to do my bit in demonstrating that women have technical knowledge too (in my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s important where possible to avoid a stage full of white men of a particular age, and I&amp;rsquo;m in a position to be able to do something about that). &amp;nbsp;And, as per usual, I was a bit nervous about this in case the only woman on the panel also turned out to look stupid, but hey, looking stupid is one of the risks of this job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the session, my gender was mentioned twice - once with &amp;ldquo;ladies first&amp;rdquo;, and once to specifically point out that our static-languages team was somehow superior because we had both genders represented (well of course we&amp;rsquo;re better, &lt;i&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m&lt;/i&gt; on the team). Note that neither of these was derogatory at all - both were, in fact, positive towards me, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t troubled or offended by them. I&amp;rsquo;m used to people noticing and commenting on my gender. &amp;nbsp;I got used to it in the same way you get used to your commute to work, or dealing with merge conflicts - it&amp;rsquo;s something you do, it&amp;rsquo;s not always comfortable, but it&amp;rsquo;s no one&amp;rsquo;s fault and they&amp;rsquo;re not out to get you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really process how the gender-mentions made me feel until after, at which point I was drained from giving yet another new talk that day, as well as the surprisingly physical panel discussion. But afterwards, when I was back in my hotel room packing for yet another plane journey, I was thinking &amp;ldquo;is it normal?&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;Was it inevitable that someone was going to notice/point out that I&amp;rsquo;m female? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it down to my choice of clothing? &amp;nbsp;I debated long and hard with myself about wearing what was definitely a ridiculously short skirt for a session like that, but in the end I decided I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wear jeans like everyone else, and wearing tiny skirts is something I find fun. But I did think I&amp;rsquo;d be behind a table and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too obvious. &amp;nbsp;Should I worry that much about what I wear? &amp;nbsp;I used to plan what to wear for work, I used to love dressing up for going out with friends, so over-thinking my clothes for a conference is part of who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one of the reasons to wear the skirt is because I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wearing jeans and t-shirts more than ever. &amp;nbsp;I think the combination of travelling a lot (I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; packing, so packing a couple of pairs of jeans and a bunch of t-shirts makes life easy) and being part of a tech company where that&amp;rsquo;s basically our uniform has lead to extreme laziness in my clothing choices, and I want to change that. &amp;nbsp;Who wants to look like everyone else? &amp;nbsp;Not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back in that hotel room, at the end of a long day, knowing I have to get up at 5am the next morning to get on a plane to New York, I felt drained. &amp;nbsp;I felt&amp;hellip; vulnerable? But if I dig down to find out what&amp;rsquo;s really making me feel not-cool, it&amp;rsquo;s not because a couple of people noticed I was a girl. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s because I was tired, because I was on display, because I had been worried about my choice of clothes, because drawing attention to yourself is not terribly British, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if my new talk was any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to blame impostor syndrome, or something similar. And maybe this is what impostor syndrome feels like. But I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure every conference speaker, whatever their gender, race, sexual orientation, age, has felt this way. &amp;nbsp;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s because I have two X chromosomes and I&amp;rsquo;m in a male-dominated environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what conclusions to draw from this experience. &amp;nbsp;I did want to share it so that other people know what it feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re tired, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to blame the first thing that springs to mind for your lack of shiny-happy feelings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot on your plate, seemingly-innocuous (even those driven by positive intentions) comments or actions can increase your stress levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t think too much. &amp;nbsp;It can drive you mad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So, FOSDEM.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve heard great things about this conference, so I was pretty exited to go&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PmLM8wpvxns/UvaWZpqWFeI/AAAAAAAAMxI/dqKWFf_PH4M/s1600/JavaDevRoom.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PmLM8wpvxns/UvaWZpqWFeI/AAAAAAAAMxI/dqKWFf_PH4M/s1600/JavaDevRoom.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The Java dev room&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Now I know people talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&#34;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; whenever they mention the woeful lack of diversity at tech conferences.&amp;nbsp; Interestingly, I felt like an impostor at FOSDEM - not because I&#39;m a woman (there were quite a few techy women around at FOSDEM, more than I expected) but because I&#39;m not an open source person.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I mean, I am, technically - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; and the Java driver are both open source, and I have real live code on github.&amp;nbsp; But I didn&#39;t get there via the open source community, I was hired to do a specific job that happens to be open source (for which I am extremely grateful).&amp;nbsp; So although I knew the MongoDB folks I was there with and a lot of people who were running or speaking in the Java room, I didn&#39;t feel really at home in this conference.&amp;nbsp; I think I feel more comfortable with the ones aimed at enterprise Java developers (by which I mean Java people who work producing software for companies) because this is more similar to my background - I understand the attendees and I think I know what they want.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It&#39;s also possible since I&#39;ve been to a lot more of the enterprise-aimed conferences that I used to feel just as awkward there, and I&#39;ve become much more comfortable now I&#39;ve been to many.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Which leads me to another observation: when I first went to JavaOne, in 2011, I felt extremely conspicuous as a woman.&amp;nbsp; I mean, I didn&#39;t do much to help, my skirts and shorts are occasionally… not really enterprise-developer-length.&amp;nbsp; But I felt like everyone noticed me and I felt the pressure to assert early on in every new conversation that I was, in fact, a developer and not a booth babe or a recruiter.&amp;nbsp; But these days, I feel much more comfortable.&amp;nbsp; And do you know what&#39;s really helped with that?&amp;nbsp; Being a speaker; having my face on the website.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have to prove I&#39;m a developer, I was asked to speak at that conference - if the conference organisers think I belong there, then I belong there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So… what.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Well, we can do things to combat this I-don&#39;t-belong-here feeling -&amp;nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve all been there, regardless of gender, race, background etc. &amp;nbsp;To be honest, us geeks probably feel this more than most humans.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Conferences and user groups and meet ups and so forth can all make life a little easier for those feeling this.&amp;nbsp; At the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, for example, we started having greeters at the door for our social events, to try and make everyone feel welcomed and to introduce people to each other.&amp;nbsp; I also liked what YOW did - they had a really informal social event at the end of the first day of the conference (with free booze, yay!) which made it relatively easy to mingle with other people.&amp;nbsp; FOSDEM, with its lack of free food and drink gave us less opportunities to mingle with people other than your own friends, although I did like the canteen area for random encounters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;But it&#39;s not just down to organisers of groups or events to solve this problem for us. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve found that if you do feel like you don&#39;t belong, there&#39;s a way to get over that, and it&#39;s not to withdraw.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s to get more involved.&amp;nbsp; Find the groups you feel most comfortable with (for me, it started at the LJC), find the medium that you&#39;re most comfortable with (in person meet-ups, e-mail, IRC, Twitter, whatever), and join in.&amp;nbsp; Have conversations.&amp;nbsp; Meet people.&amp;nbsp; Once you start to make friends you start to feel like you belong, and when you start to feel like you belong you can step up and do more.&amp;nbsp; You might even find yourself accidentally propelled into speaking at an international conference, and who knows where you find yourself after that?&amp;nbsp; Although I appreciate that&#39;s not for everyone.&amp;nbsp; The point is, find your comfort zone for entry and gradually push yourself more - as you find yourself more accepted and respected, you&#39;ll feel less like an outsider. &amp;nbsp;At the very least, you&#39;ll have friends to talk to at these sorts of events.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;And don&#39;t be put off by a couple of bad experiences - you don&#39;t have to go back to that group, those people, that thing, but don&#39;t assume that all groups or events are like that. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve been to a number of events, techy or otherwise, that I didn&#39;t feel at home with. &amp;nbsp;If, after two tries (in person, I&#39;ll give e-mails lists or chat rooms many more chances), I still don&#39;t get on with it, I try somewhere else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;There are still going to be times when you&#39;re not in your comfort zone, but this is probably healthy - pushing yourself a little leads to different opportunities.&amp;nbsp; And in my case, it reminded me what it was like to be an outsider, a newbie.&amp;nbsp; And that gives us greater empathy for people in that situation.&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&amp;rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. &amp;nbsp;A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PWSc0RE99iQ/UrhWxezIRSI/AAAAAAAAMB8/wQSmg4lwVl8/s1600/Cliff.jpg&#34;

is a long way away from Australia) but make it cost effective - although you have to shuttle the speakers between the cities, you have the speakers for nearly two weeks and get the material three times in the three different locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVUihtZxvfY/UrhXL-fc8cI/AAAAAAAAMCE/J9RjMWAhOjY/s1600/1Coogee.jpg&#34;

It looked at each of the SOLID principles, where they came from, what they are, helped us understand why we need to care about them (or not). &amp;nbsp;It became clear to me that as we become more experienced, as we grow, we need to continually re-visit the things we think we know, or the basics of what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, as you&amp;rsquo;ll find things there that surprise you - things you thought you understood, or things that you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand before and now have more context for. &amp;nbsp;In particular, I learnt another argument against using inheritance willy-nilly (one of my current favourite bug-bears)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing software is like writing fiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts say &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo; because they know a number of rules which might be applicable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t change &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html&#34;&gt;published interfaces&lt;/a&gt; because other people are dependent upon your code (pretty much the entire basis of my Backwards Compatibility talk), but if you own the code you can change it to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f116466b93322f4900000f?track=Service+%2F+API+Design&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Creating Observable APIs with Rx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ben Christensen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/benjchristensen&#34;&gt;@benjchristensen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Netflix are doing some really amazing stuff with architecture, design and code, and what I love the most is that they&amp;rsquo;re willing to share it with the rest of us. Rx and reactive programming are big buzz words at the moment, and the event-driven, asynchronous approach is something that we embraced at LMAX and is now, to my mind, an &amp;ldquo;obvious&amp;rdquo; way to create scalable systems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I liked Ben&amp;rsquo;s visualisation of the events in the system using marble diagrams, and I liked that he showed us code and walked through it. &amp;nbsp;There were a number of things to get your head around in the talk, and I personally would like to see it again to see what I missed first time around. &amp;nbsp;Definitely worth watching if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this way of coding, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a paradigm that will be used more and more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51fbdf7d9bd61f5a2a00000c?track=Peopleware&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Hiring (or Growing) the Right Agile Coach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lyssa Adkins (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lyssaadkins&#34;&gt;@lyssaadkins&lt;/a&gt;) and Michael Spayd (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mspayd&#34;&gt;@mspayd&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it never occurred to me that you could create a framework for professional development for agile coaches. &amp;nbsp;Lyssa and Michael have done just that, and having something a bit more formalised helps figure out what a coach needs to do in order to develop further. &amp;nbsp;Agile coach, scrum master, iteration lead&amp;hellip; all these titles do not currently tell anyone how good you are at the job or what your strengths and weaknesses are. &amp;nbsp;The Agile Coach Competency Framework seems like a good starting point for conversations around: the coaches you have; the coaches you need; your current skills as a coach; the direction you want to go in as a coach. &amp;nbsp;If you need to hire or develop an agile coach, or if you are a professional in this space, this is worth looking at.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef8426950e81d4a300000b?track=Concurrency&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Disruptor 3.0: Details and Advanced Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mike Barker (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mikeb2701&#34;&gt;@mikeb2701&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was so pleased to hang around with my old LMAX colleague during YOW that I totally failed to take the time to see all of this talk. &amp;nbsp;Depending upon the city it either clashed with mine or was immediately before. &amp;nbsp;However, it&amp;rsquo;s a must-see for fans of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, Mike goes into detail about what&amp;rsquo;s in the latest version of the Disruptor, how and why these things work. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be watching the video when it&amp;rsquo;s online.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef9cf09ff771058e00001b?track=Keynote&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Angle Brackets, Curly Braces, JavaScript &amp;amp;

at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/lean-software-and-systems-conference.html&#34;&gt;Lean conference at Bletchley in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In this talk I was struck once again how important the words we use are: should, given/when/then, and so on, giving us a framework for thinking about a problem. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons I wanted to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/spock&#34;&gt;move towards Spock&lt;/a&gt;, because it forces the use of some of these words.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wrote lots of notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assume you got it wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a context in which the event will create a different outcome? (Your account is empty, the ATM is out of cash, you have a pre-approved overdraft)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t think of the software that will solve the problem, assume it will be done by pixies (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/index.php/Iconograph&#34;&gt;Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s Iconograph&lt;/a&gt;), forcing us to stop thinking of solutions when we&amp;rsquo;re trying to outline the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all user stories are about the user, they might be about other stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acceptance criteria vs scenarios - &amp;ldquo;Can you give me an example?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask why a change needs to be made or why something is a bug, if I&amp;rsquo;ve messed up this feature I might have messed up something else&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testers do think differently to developers, they have a process of deliberate discovery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BA/Dev/Tester huddle - the three amigos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a project has no risks, don&amp;rsquo;t do it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complicated/Complex/Chaotic/Simple projects/systems. &amp;nbsp;Some types of systems don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves well to BDD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the risk is in Complex problems, and this is also likely where the value is. &amp;nbsp;This is the area that developers tend to like to live.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Afterwards I questioned Liz on her separation of Devs and Testers in the talk - this seems contra to the current trend of hiring developers-in-test or other moves to make QAs and developers one-team-one-dream. &amp;nbsp;She pointed out that it&amp;rsquo;s less of a job description and more of a role that people take in a team. &amp;nbsp;Then she suggested I was currently in a tester role, not developer, as my mindset is very much focussed around proving our code quality rather than jumping in and implementing features. &amp;nbsp;I think it was meant as a positive thing&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In Sam&amp;rsquo;s talk I got an idea of why microservices are a Good Thing, and how you might go about moving in that direction. &amp;nbsp;There was practical advice on things you should be doing if you&amp;rsquo;re using this kind of architecture:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align your services with your organisational structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microservices let you deploy independently and move faster, and you can run each service in whichever technology / language is right for the job&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standardisation vs autonomy - standardisation between services, autonomy within.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick conventions and stick with them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try not to support distributed transactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to get better at monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can create tracer messages that flow through the system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create templates that do the right thing, make it easy for people to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f109ba6b9332a9d4000008?track=Visualisation&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Google Earth Engine: Enabling Science with Novel Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mike Dixon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I saw this because I&amp;rsquo;m interested in geolocation and geo-stuff at the moment, but this talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t really about the sort of thing I&amp;rsquo;m playing around with. &amp;nbsp;It was (to my mind) really interesting material though - using satellite images from the past few decades to spot patterns and predict things. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to see applications of technology that could potentially impact the whole world, rather than just things that make money for companies. &amp;nbsp;My Dad, who&amp;rsquo;s a geography teacher, would have loved this talk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef87399ff771873d000010?track=Cloud+At+Scale&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Cloud Native Architecture at Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adrian Cockcroft (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/adrianco&#34;&gt;@adrianco&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Really interesting talk, always to a packed room, about how Netflix has created a scalable architecture. &amp;nbsp;As I said earlier, I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed with what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in their chaos monkeys and primates. &amp;nbsp;I definitely recommend seeing this presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A look under the covers of how Facebook ships things. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting contrast to the Netflix, microservices approach. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s great to see the different approaches at the same conference, maybe it gives people an idea of the pros and cons of each way forward. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I particularly liked from Facebook was that the teams seem to be set a goal, and then they&amp;rsquo;re free (to some extent) to pick what to work on in order to meet that goal. &amp;nbsp;There&amp;rsquo;s definitely an experimentation side to things (very Lean Startup again), a lack of fear of trying new things, some stuff will work and some won&amp;rsquo;t, that&amp;rsquo;s life. &amp;nbsp;But at the end of the day there&amp;rsquo;s a definite measurable that will tell you if you&amp;rsquo;re doing the right thing or not. &amp;nbsp;On the VM team, the aim is to get CPU cycles down, that&amp;rsquo;s it. &amp;nbsp;This is a very different approach to having a backlog of stories that&amp;rsquo;s prioritised by the business. &amp;nbsp;Interesting and useful stuff in this talk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef98ef9ff771873d000042?track=Adopting+FP&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned from Adopting Clojure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jay Fields (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/thejayfields&#34;&gt;@thejayfields&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I went to this talk because I chatted to Jay a number of times throughout the travelling circus, and I liked him - I have almost zero interest in Clojure at this moment in time. &amp;nbsp;But I&amp;rsquo;m really glad I went, because I learnt loads of stuff that&amp;rsquo;s relevant for my day job (who knew?). &amp;nbsp;This presentation is basically about how to introduce a new language into a company/team, and he&amp;rsquo;s able to show the process over a period of several years, which in our industry is a life-time - many talks are around the latest, shiniest thing a company has introduced. &amp;nbsp;He speaks frankly about the cost of introducing a new language, gives some good advice on the approach to take, and personally made me wonder if I might have bitten off more than I can chew by sneaking Groovy into the Java driver via Spock and Gradle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t force people to use a different editor AND a different language - if you take away both comfort zones you&amp;rsquo;ll meet resistance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the other tools in place too - ant, maven, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose non-production code to try it out on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose code that showcases the power of the language, its strengths&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose something that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to keep in the old language, in case it all goes horribly wrong and you have to go back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve introduced a new language, you&amp;rsquo;ve just given yourself a second full-time job - supporting that language, training people, etc. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to know everything - you are the expert. &amp;nbsp;Read everything.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a budget for training and support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s practical to get your career sorted before playing with new technologies&amp;rdquo; (I wrote that down and now don&amp;rsquo;t remember the context, but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting point)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s so many things you can do by innovating and adopting a new language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51fbdd9b2e4c941eff00000c?track=Agile+Practices&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Focusing the Core Domain: Domain-Driven Design Case Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eric Evans (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ericevans0&#34;&gt;@ericevans0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I always love meeting people who&amp;rsquo;s books I&amp;rsquo;ve read (or at least, started). &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in the Domain Driven Design stuff since the guys were banging on about it at LMAX, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use some of the concepts to drive the design of the new Java driver for MongoDB. This presentation was a specific (anonymised) case study of applying Domain Driven Design. &amp;nbsp;My main take away point is that &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; plunging into development, that asking questions, that waiting, is sometimes the best thing you can do. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef94039ff771873d00003d?track=Mobile+Development&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Mobile Web Whirlwind Tour of PhoneGap, Cordova &amp;amp;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Scrum-type methodologies tend to focus on user stories and feature delivery. &amp;nbsp;This presentation talks about physically colouring the different types of work that you have in your backlog (tech debt, bugs, stories, architecture) and understanding how to prioritise each of them. &amp;nbsp;This talk is worth seeing if you are in a Scrum-ish environment, and you have a backlog of stories. &amp;nbsp;If you&amp;rsquo;re struggling to find time to address tech debt, this is probably applicable too. &amp;nbsp;For me, the take-away point was simply having visibility of the different types of work - often the backlog only contains stories, and the other stuff is missing. &amp;nbsp;From there, you&amp;rsquo;re in a better position to work out how to prioritise things.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/52725f4c403edc223500004f?track=Mobile+Development&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;No App is an Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stewart Gleadow (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/stewgleadow&#34;&gt;@stewgleadow&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;More and more people are talking about APIs, especially as we now have lots of different ways of getting to data/applications, even if you just think web/phone/tablet. &amp;nbsp;Stew gives very solid advice on how to build APIs so that you can correctly separate back- and front-end, and create (specifically) great iOS apps. &amp;nbsp;There&amp;rsquo;s a good intro to what REST really means too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different devices don&amp;rsquo;t have to share the same API if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Objective C: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like ugly Ruby, or beautiful Java&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From day one send the information about the client version, the handset etc. to the server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must worry about backwards compatibility because there&amp;rsquo;s a very long tail on app upgrades&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Libraries that bind your JSON have tight coupling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can ship client code that checks if a feature is available on the server and ignore it if not - that lets you turn on the feature at the server-end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage upgrades to the new version, by doing things like &amp;ldquo;if you had version 347 you could use this feature&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phone application is the hardest thing to change so it should not be your integration point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need an anti-corruption layer, your phone should not be pointing to the internal systems. &amp;nbsp;This will be your mobile API, and can include caching and security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your logic is in the client, it&amp;rsquo;s in the place that&amp;rsquo;s hardest to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

a number of times this year. &amp;nbsp;It morphed from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;into two different talks - &amp;ldquo;Design is a Process, not a Document&amp;rdquo; and a more MongoDB-focussed one, which I reused the original title for. &amp;nbsp;This newer, MongoDB-focussed one is what I gave at GOTO Berlin, and I decided to use this for YOW as it&amp;rsquo;s a technical (ish) talk that goes into some detail about MongoDB, and they do pay my rent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The really great (or possibly, bad) thing about YOW is that because it&amp;rsquo;s the same conference at three venues, only a few days apart, it gives you a chance to put your Lean Startup knowledge into practice - you can experiment, get feedback, and improve. &amp;nbsp;Like the GOTOs/QCons, they have a Green/Yellow/Red feedback system from the audience so you can get a feel for how they liked your talk (the Aussies are a bit non-committal, they were keen on the Yellow button - commit one way or another!! (or don&amp;rsquo;t, I don&amp;rsquo;t want more reds)). &amp;nbsp;So decided to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&#34;&gt;A/B test&lt;/a&gt; my talk - at Melbourne, I gave the GOTO Berlin one; at Brisbane, the original one with updated code and design diagrams. &amp;nbsp;Since the Brisbane one got a higher score, I went with that with some minor tweaks for Sydney. &amp;nbsp;The upshot is, people like hand-drawn pictures of monsters, and are less keen on understanding the internals of MongoDB. &amp;nbsp;That&amp;rsquo;s useful to know.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br class=&#34;Apple-interchange-newline&#34; /&gt;But the talks aren&amp;rsquo;t the only things that make a conference. &amp;nbsp;And YOW got the other stuff right too:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s1600/1Catamaran.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s320/1Catamaran.jpg&#34; width=&#34;265&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved the drinks receptions in the evenings, that&amp;rsquo;s a great place for people to come and ask you questions about your talk, stuff they might not want to share in front of everyone. &amp;nbsp;Note to attendees - if you do see a speaker at a drinks/network/mingle event, feel free to chat to them. &amp;nbsp;We&amp;rsquo;re there for you guys, and we&amp;rsquo;re only people ourselves and like the company. &amp;nbsp;At many events, the speakers know very few people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sydney had an outdoor eating area, which was awesome - if you&amp;rsquo;re going to spend weeks in a conference hall, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to get outside for food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a, um, misunderstanding about appropriate dress code for one of the vendors. &amp;nbsp;The conference organisers were on this immediately, and, to their credit, the vendor acted swiftly with no fuss. &amp;nbsp;A great example of how to handle this sort of thing at tech conferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having all the travel and accommodation, particularly for this complicated trip, arranged by very capable and approachable people made the speakers&amp;rsquo; lives really easy, and I think that helped us to be more prepared and relaxed for our talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A speaker&amp;rsquo;s excursion (on a boat!) at the weekend was an amazing way to bond with the other guys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I loved YOW, I hope I can go again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get
there, and not because of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/27/its-ok-to-take-the-morning-off-work-if-storm-hits-michael-fish-says-so-4162862/&#34;&gt;Super Storm&lt;/a&gt;.  Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on
Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute,
oh no&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java
Community. For example, presenting were: &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/andy-piper&#34;&gt;Andy Piper&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a
href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/barry-cranford&#34;&gt;Barry Cranford&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/james-gough&#34;&gt;Jim
Gough&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/peter-lawrey&#34;&gt;Peter Lawrey&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon
.com/speakers/sandro-mancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro Mancuso&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/simon-maple&#34;&gt;Simon Maple&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a
href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/martijn-verburg&#34;&gt;Martijn Verburg&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/john-oliver&#34;&gt;John
Oliver&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/john-stevenson&#34;&gt;John Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon
.com/speakers/richard-warburton&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&lt;/a&gt;. The Community Night in particular also drew a lot of LJC members (including some
 first-timers) to JAX, and it was a really good &amp;ldquo;networking opportunity&amp;rdquo; (i.e. chance to have free drinks,
 catch up with friends and make new ones). I really enjoyed hanging out with everyone at JAX this year,
 I was tempted to write the names of everyone I spoke to and had fun with because it really made my conference,
 but I think that would make a very boring blog post. But if I spoke to you at JAX, you made my journey from Spain worthwhile,
 thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the LJC-types, there were some other really big name speakers too,
 including MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s Chairman &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/dwight-merriman&#34;&gt;Dwight Merriman&lt;/a&gt;. Highlights for me
 were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ken Sipe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spockframework.org/&#34;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt; talk. I saw this at GeeCON and that&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;a href=&#34;/tags/spock/&#34;&gt;I started using
Spock&lt;/a&gt; to test the MongoDB Java driver, but it was great to see it again and pick up some extra tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ted Neward&amp;rsquo;s talk at the community night about being a CTO at a startup. It was really interesting,
and nice to see a realistic view of the difficulties of that role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Governor&amp;rsquo;s keynote on how Java got its Mojo back. I like seeing facts and figures to back up a viewpoint,
and as you&amp;rsquo;d expect from the founder of an analyst firm, this talk was full of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As James mentioned during his talk, the audience at JAX was, as in previous years, somewhat passive. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why,
 as around 50% of the audience came from outside the UK so we can&amp;rsquo;t even blame English reticence. And in a conference full of
 outspoken LJC-types, it seems an odd thing to have an unresponsive audience. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the venue,
 the main hall in particular seems to lend itself to sitting quietly in the audience and expecting to be entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented four times at JAX, because, well, on home turf one ends up doing more than one expects.
 - Firstly, a tutorial on the new Java driver for MongoDB (more on this later);
 - Secondly, a clinic for novice speakers. This was a lot of fun, and I think it was useful for everyone. I&amp;rsquo;d love to run
 this again (I probably will at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/ljcopenconference/&#34;&gt;LJC Open Conference&lt;/a&gt;). The aim
 is to give new speakers confidence, not focus on details like building a slide deck.
 - Thirdly, the third time out for my &amp;ldquo;Design is a Process, not a Document&amp;rdquo; presentation. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively interactive
 presentation, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think worked so well at JAX, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fun presentation to give.
 - Finally, not only did I get roped into being on the panel for &amp;ldquo;How to start a community&amp;rdquo; at the community night, I ended up, somehow,
  moderating it. That was fun, it was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been a moderator, it&amp;rsquo;s a role I usually avoid as moderators ought to
  limit the amount of talking they do, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound fun to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tutorial materials are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/mongodb-java-tutorial&#34;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
provided a lot of guidance on how to get started online, but the exercises are there, and the slides which present the concepts and
suggest the order to tackle the tests in. If people use these materials, please feel free to give me feedback on them,
but be nice - they were designed for an in-person tutorial, not an online one. But it is a good way to get a feel for the new
MongoDB Java API (in its current, unfinished, state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, JAX London - great speakers, and a good conference to meet not only Londoners, but a lot of international people too.&lt;/p&gt;

Very informative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/5251c164e4b0a43ac1212459/about&#34;&gt;Lambda: A Peek under the hood&lt;/a&gt; - Brian Goetz goes into detail of how lambdas are actually implemented. &amp;nbsp;Not something an everyday developer needs to know in order to use them, but extremely useful if you want to understand things like their performance, and why they&amp;rsquo;re not simply syntactic sugar. &amp;nbsp;Despite thinking I understood this stuff, I still had to watch this twice (once at JavaOne and once at GOTO Aarhus) before I could say I understood it. &amp;nbsp;Totally worthwhile making the effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/524f0463e4b0ab14e307d7bc/about&#34;&gt;Making Java Groovy&lt;/a&gt; - A great, engaging talk about how Groovy and Java can live side by side, and showcasing some of the nice features of Groovy. &amp;nbsp;I found this particularly helpful now we&amp;rsquo;re using Spock and Gradle, and learnt some new tricks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/5250370ee4b0c4f11ec57641/about&#34;&gt;MongoDB for Hibernate/JPA developers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Obviously Justin is my colleague, so I should give him a shout out. &amp;nbsp;But what I like about this talk is that it does what it says on the tin - introduces MongoDB for those of us who are/were used to working with out databases in a particular way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6LKajHbAm6Y/UnjSZ7_2QlI/AAAAAAAAL8o/8XA5AVvEYP4/s1600/DSC_0626.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6LKajHbAm6Y/UnjSZ7_2QlI/AAAAAAAAL8o/8XA5AVvEYP4/s320/DSC_0626.jpg&#34; width=&#34;211&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also liked Martijn &amp;amp; Ben&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3802&#34;&gt;Lean Startup Ninja&lt;/a&gt; talk, even if they weren&amp;rsquo;t terribly complimentary towards MongoDB. &amp;nbsp;The talk doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be on Parleys yet, but keep an eye out for it - it&amp;rsquo;s a nice, realistic view of the trials and tribulations of running a startup.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These great sessions were really a bonus for me. &amp;nbsp;The main reason to go to JavaOne in my opinion is to meet people - it&amp;rsquo;s west-coast, and I don&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to get to California very often. &amp;nbsp;You see or meet those who are working to advance Java-the-platform and Java-the-language, and there&amp;rsquo;s a big focus on community so you also get to meet as many of the Java User Group leaders as can make it out there. &amp;nbsp;In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the folks working hard on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.net/&#34;&gt;java.net&lt;/a&gt; website and those involved in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/home/index&#34;&gt;JCP process&lt;/a&gt;, deciding the standards of the language. &amp;nbsp;Although there&amp;rsquo;s some overlap between all these groups, by spending some time with all of them you get to meet a really wide range of people. You get to hear what people are working on, what&amp;rsquo;s coming down the line, and often get a chance to influence that too by giving your opinions (nicely, of course!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course there&amp;rsquo;s the parties too, although I&amp;rsquo;ve been threatened with being removed from the invite list of the Zero Turnaround party next year since I failed to show up this time. &amp;nbsp;My favourite was the JCP party - great food, and amazing views of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2MEmpzgCoGE/UnjTq0XVQlI/AAAAAAAAL8w/hiLFac_YcuQ/s1600/DSC_0924.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2MEmpzgCoGE/UnjTq0XVQlI/AAAAAAAAL8w/hiLFac_YcuQ/s400/DSC_0924.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WVlQ2KcG6xQ/UnjQAnkURoI/AAAAAAAAL8U/G5LjQYrY3Qo/s1600/MongoDB.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WVlQ2KcG6xQ/UnjQAnkURoI/AAAAAAAAL8U/G5LjQYrY3Qo/s400/MongoDB.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some other conference going on at the same time, over in Moscone. Something called Oracle Open World. A few of us snuck over there to take a look at the massive MongoDB stand there (in the heart of Relational-Database-World!). &amp;nbsp;Open World is a scary place filled with people in suits, looking to sell or be sold to. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s also massive. &amp;nbsp;We chatted to our mates there and then ran off to eat burritos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L5YJHRqiYsM/UnjTtx8lgkI/AAAAAAAAL88/2dZrxdLcvMU/s1600/DSC_0935.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L5YJHRqiYsM/UnjTtx8lgkI/AAAAAAAAL88/2dZrxdLcvMU/s400/DSC_0935.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A bunch of us also got a chance to go to the Google offices in San Francisco. We slid on their slide, tried Google Glass, got photos taken in their photo booth, ate their food and drank their drink. &amp;nbsp;I was pleased to see it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything like The Internship (a film I tried to watch on the plane on the way over and could not finish - I was really disappointed with the enforcement of industry stereotypes, and the portrayal of elitism. &amp;nbsp;But maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me). They also have amazing views of the bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CmZqbfcPgd4/UnjhRjjaxaI/AAAAAAAAL9I/WLlZrYDEITQ/s1600/DSC_0704.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;211&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CmZqbfcPgd4/UnjhRjjaxaI/AAAAAAAAL9I/WLlZrYDEITQ/s320/DSC_0704.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Summary&lt;/b&gt;, JavaOne is as relevant as it ever was. &amp;nbsp;The themes of this year were definitely Java 8 (lambdas in particular), alternative JVM languages (which now seem to be used enough in mature systems to be viable for more conservative organisations), &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/&#34;&gt;JavaScript on the server&lt;/a&gt;, and as always there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of noise around front end and web, although I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure Java has a really nice, easy way to create a web application. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JavaOne is still the place to go to hear what&amp;rsquo;s in the pipeline, to meet the people working on this pipeline, and to influence the future of Java.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, and I gave a talk:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;290&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; src=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/share.html#play/524f26a3e4b0a43ac1212393&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; width=&#34;420&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. &amp;nbsp;Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. &amp;nbsp;We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&amp;rsquo;s going through the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/job-interview-tips#.UiBS9_WZJyU.blogger&#34;&gt;Hire Education - Making Interviews Rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny because we talk a lot about hiring at ThoughtWorks (where we both worked, and which has one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/hardest-tech-company-job-interviews-2012-8&#34;&gt;toughest interview processes&lt;/a&gt; in the industry) and LMAX, which learnt a lot off ThoughtWorks and shaped its own process for a smaller company that has different goals. &amp;nbsp;Yet neither of us work at those places now. &amp;nbsp;Still, we share stories from many of the places we&amp;rsquo;ve worked (or chose not to work), and if there&amp;rsquo;s one take-home point, it&amp;rsquo;s that hiring (and being hired) is not a simple thing to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I did miss Twitter and Facebook while I was out there, and the WiFi availability was limited. &amp;nbsp;Also, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m paranoid, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how much to trust the WiFi. &amp;nbsp;But I found myself quite pleased to be separated from the interwebs for a bit - it was peaceful and relaxing. &amp;nbsp;I even did more work than I expected, probably because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t replying to e-mails all the time or thinking of what to tweet next.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conference itself was a weird mix of the familiar with the massively unfamiliar - familiar, because it &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; like a JavaOne - the branding, the badges, the signage. &amp;nbsp;Unfamiliar because I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Chinese - most of the signs and documentation were in Chinese, and not all the stewards spoke English. &amp;nbsp;The attendees in particular were not expected to speak English (which is totally understandable of course! Conferences should cater for the local population), which made it more difficult to feel like a part of the event. &amp;nbsp;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before that the more I come to these events, the less I feel like an outsider as one of the rare women. &amp;nbsp;But as a blonde-haired European woman I did feel a little&amp;hellip; conspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oOKZpQA9aiM/Ufkc24I2QvI/AAAAAAAALoo/KDA5LT4htD8/s1600/DSC_0217.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oOKZpQA9aiM/Ufkc24I2QvI/AAAAAAAALoo/KDA5LT4htD8/s640/DSC_0217.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;It was an Oracle conference. &amp;nbsp;In case you&amp;rsquo;re not sure.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Oracle probably like the fact that the event is small enough that Open World and JavaOne can be in the same place at the same time, but to me it feels a bit odd. &amp;nbsp;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily find the content that was applicable to me as a Java developer, and I really don&amp;rsquo;t see much crossover between the two conferences - I can&amp;rsquo;t see what I, as a developer, would get out of &amp;ldquo;How to use Oracle blah blah more effectively&amp;rdquo;.  And I can&amp;rsquo;t see the suited business types enjoying &amp;ldquo;Effective Scala&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s less obvious than at the SF conference(s), but there&amp;rsquo;s a very distinct difference between the JavaOne attendees (emphasis on the casual part of business casual) and the Oracle people (do they sleep in their suits?).  I didn&amp;rsquo;t envy the latter at all - wearing a full suit and tie in 40°C heat and humidity you could drown in must be extremely uncomfortable.&amp;nbsp;Speaking of clothes, all the women are dressed in summery, pretty clothes (except the business-suited Oracle types), and looked like normal human beings, and the geek guys were wearing less badges of geekness (geek t-shirts, jeans etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did seem to be a great conference to get people from all over Asia and even the antipodes together.  There was buzz in the air, an excitement to be learning stuff and meeting people. &amp;nbsp;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s the (relatively) small size of the conference, its youth or its geography, or maybe simply me projecting my excitement at being in a place I&amp;rsquo;d never been to before, but there was less cynicism than in the western conferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HnWFwFqbyUs/Ufkc3GqPjCI/AAAAAAAALos/zOoIsSqSzCs/s1600/DSC_0221.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HnWFwFqbyUs/Ufkc3GqPjCI/AAAAAAAALos/zOoIsSqSzCs/s640/DSC_0221.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Awesome to see the LJC get a shout out in China!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In terms of presenting, this was an entirely new experience for me. &amp;nbsp;The slides had all been translated into Chinese&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned I don&amp;rsquo;t speak, so this meant I had to have my laptop out with my English notes on, as well as the slides on the main screen. &amp;nbsp;I had two remotes, one in each hand, and I advanced both sets of slides at the same time. The fact that the slide on the screen was also on a monitor in front of me made it relatively easy to make sure I had both in sync, but it did require a bit of extra cognitive power. &amp;nbsp;I felt lucky that most of my slides are practically content-less - if my presentations followed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://presentationpatterns.com/glossary/#bullet-riddledcorpse&#34;&gt;Bullet-Riddled Corpse pattern&lt;/a&gt; a) the poor translator would have had to work harder and b) it would have been more difficult to work out which slide I was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RGTON8Wogt0/UfkjPmpqg5I/AAAAAAAALqc/p8bTKu5qiRg/s1600/2013-07-23+16.28.37.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RGTON8Wogt0/UfkjPmpqg5I/AAAAAAAALqc/p8bTKu5qiRg/s640/2013-07-23+16.28.37.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Half of my massive audience&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In addition, my presentation was being interpreted in real time as I spoke. &amp;nbsp;I was worried about the interpreter - I know I speak too fast, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if Chinese is one of those languages where it takes more words to say the same thing&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;So I needed to make sure I slowed down, spoke clearly and coherently, and left longer pauses. &amp;nbsp;These are things you should do as a presenter anyway, but it always feels a little unnatural. &amp;nbsp;And in fact the more you present, the easier it is to forget this, especially if you get good feedback on your talks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To deal with both these different things (Chinese slides and real time interpretation), I had to be prepared earlier than normal and I practiced more than normal. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to get the timing right so I would be comfortable slowing down. &amp;nbsp;I wanted it to be 40 minutes (in a 60 minute slot) to give me 10 mins for questions and 10 mins buffer for allowing me to slow down and/or cope with any disasters. &amp;nbsp;I needed to run through with the Chinese slides so there weren&amp;rsquo;t any nasty surprises.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the end, I thought it went very well. &amp;nbsp;The preparation made me feel much more comfortable and confident. &amp;nbsp;Slowing down had an additional benefit - not everyone opted for the headphones &amp;amp; interpreter, so me not speaking at 100 miles an hour gave them a fighting chance of following along. &amp;nbsp;The audience seemed very reluctant to ask questions in public, so I skipped my usual audience-participation bit, but the fact that I hit 40 minutes exactly gave people loads of time to come up to me afterwards and ask me questions, and I did have quite a big line of people as I was packing up. I think this is a Good Thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fortunately (for me) the session was not recorded in any form, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see whether it really was any good or not. &amp;nbsp;But here are the slides, in case you speak Chinese (sadly my Keynote to Powerpoint conversion didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work, so some of the code falls off the bottom).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/24790295&#34; width=&#34;476&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note that my caveats are in Chinese, but the caveats are that the new API for the MongoDB Java driver will almost definitely NOT look like that, it&amp;rsquo;s just indicative of the direction we were looking in when I wrote that presentation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was more nervous about this session than recent sessions, I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased I did it. &amp;nbsp;I highly recommend this to other speakers as a way to force you out of your routine and to think about your presentation style (something we probably all stress about anyway, but this forces you to look carefully at it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Shanghai overall&amp;hellip; as you can probably gather from the start of this blog, I liked it a lot. &amp;nbsp;I had a nice, mostly relaxing, fun time there. &amp;nbsp;I loved the modern-ness of it, like the ridiculously fast MagLev that takes a mere 7 minutes to travel the 30km to the airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N4uxMHHBqP8/Ufj39c6HFlI/AAAAAAAALnk/LkqJmrUtQYM/s1600/MagLevSpeed.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;90&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N4uxMHHBqP8/Ufj39c6HFlI/AAAAAAAALnk/LkqJmrUtQYM/s320/MagLevSpeed.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The Shanghai MagLev is &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest train in regular commercial service&amp;rdquo;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I liked the alienness, after countless European and American cities. &amp;nbsp;I did not like not being able to speak the language, or the fact that taxi drivers don&amp;rsquo;t want to take you to the Expo area where our hotel was. &amp;nbsp;I liked the many touches of familiarity and the atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;d definitely go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WCwgvIYVSPc/Ufk0x8cl66I/AAAAAAAALq8/56LFQqYJwfg/s1600/DSC_0227.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WCwgvIYVSPc/Ufk0x8cl66I/AAAAAAAALq8/56LFQqYJwfg/s640/DSC_0227.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Pollution makes awesome sunsets&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKRXrTupRYE/Ufk0x683cTI/AAAAAAAALrA/QOdN4Mu0rXQ/s1600/DSC_0064.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKRXrTupRYE/Ufk0x683cTI/AAAAAAAALrA/QOdN4Mu0rXQ/s640/DSC_0064.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s whetted my appetite for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; so I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to San Francisco in September.
