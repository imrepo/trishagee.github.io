      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandatory initial exclamation about how little I have blogged here lately.  Over a year without
updates, oh dear!  But a) I have been blogging quite a lot for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/author/trishagee/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/author/trishagee/&#34;&gt;Upsource&lt;/a&gt; blogs, and b) I had another
baby, which kept me quite busy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on that topic (more or less) I get a lot of questions about my job: what&amp;rsquo;s involved in the
job, what&amp;rsquo;s it like working for JetBrains, what does a Developer Advocate do, what&amp;rsquo;s it like
working remotely etc etc.  Given I also rather generously&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; recently offered to answer
people&amp;rsquo;s questions about my job, I thought the most scalable way was to write-once-read-many,
i.e. write it in a single blog post for everyone to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Also, if you&amp;#39;re vaguely contemplating a move into an advocacy-type role and interested to find out what&amp;#39;s involved (and/or if it will suit you) feel free to Tweet/DM/e-mail me with questions and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to brain-dump my experience onto you&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Trisha Gee (@trisha_gee) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee/status/979014330631979010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Very Long Post.  It&amp;rsquo;s also a bit of a brain dump and is not well organised, sorry.  I
take comfort in the fact that if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the role you won&amp;rsquo;t read it, and if you do
care you&amp;rsquo;re probably interested in all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I get is &amp;ldquo;How does one become a Developer Advocate?&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve already
written about &lt;a href=&#34;/post/becoming_an_evangelist&#34;&gt;My Path to Evangelism&lt;/a&gt;, which covers how I got into
this job.  My route is not the only route, but at the bottom of that post there are some things you
can do to a) see if you like doing this kind of thing b) improve your skills in this area and c) get the
 experience and visibility you need to make it easier for someone to hire you to do this
 professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishagee/&#34;&gt;Developer Advocate for JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;. Developer
Advocates/Evangelists come in various different shapes and sizes depending upon the individual
and the organisation.  At JetBrains advocates do advocacy first and foremost (see the next
section which explains a bit about what I mean).  For me, this means I:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physically go to &lt;em&gt;conferences&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;give presentations&lt;/em&gt;.  I prefer live coding demos, because I
think a) it makes me look clever and b) it showcases the tools nicely. This is not a requirement
of the role, it&amp;rsquo;s something I personally chose because I thought it was good for my personal
&amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo; (this is linked a bit to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m a female developer, more on that later).
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hhariri&#34;&gt;Hadi&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; talks are more varied than mine, he has plenty that aren&amp;rsquo;t
specifically code-related.&lt;br /&gt;
From JetBrains point of view, if you&amp;rsquo;re out at conferences giving popular talks, that makes
the company look good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I am physically in a country/city I may also seek out &lt;em&gt;user groups&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt; to go
and see. This is not a requirement of the job, but it&amp;rsquo;s something I want to do more of and get
better at.  It&amp;rsquo;s very effective and fairly limited extra overhead to also give the same talk you&amp;rsquo;re
giving at some conference to the local user group and some customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer meetings&lt;/em&gt;. When I originally took this role,
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be doing a bit of consulting as part of the job, e.g. going to a customer and
trouble-shooting their TeamCity installation or running tailored training courses on IntelliJ
IDEA.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been here three years and I haven&amp;rsquo;t done that.  I have, however, done pre-sales
trips to demo a particular product (usually &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/&#34;&gt;Upsource&lt;/a&gt; and answer questions about it: what does
it do, how does it scale, where will it fit into this company&amp;rsquo;s process, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve only
physically had to travel for these a couple of times, usually a company is more than happy to
have me present this via a private webinar.  These webinars can sometimes be to a huge number of
developers (hundreds), more usually to 10-20 techies, occasionally just to one or two people.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a webinar or a physical meeting, I always, always have backup to help me with
things I don&amp;rsquo;t know.  I&amp;rsquo;m a technical advocate, I understand how to use the tool really well. I
don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know everything on the roadmap (that&amp;rsquo;s usually the PMM), nor do I know all
the technical limitations (a lead techy will know this). It scares me a bit going into these
meetings knowing that I don&amp;rsquo;t know everything, but sometimes I have someone with me (either
physically at the meeting or online with me during the webinar) and I always have someone
available via Slack to answer any questions I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe my
credibility has suffered when I&amp;rsquo;ve said &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to that, let me quickly find
out&amp;rdquo;, especially when there&amp;rsquo;s almost always a fast response. If there&amp;rsquo;s no adequate response
there and then, I make a note of the question and promise to get back to them. I usually end
the meeting by repeating the next steps and listing the information I believe I have to find
out for them, and always follow up with an email. If the answers were quick to find, all the
answers will be in the follow up email. If the answers are still pending, I will tell them
that in the quick response and get back to them later with the answers (e.g. I don&amp;rsquo;t leave
them hanging with no response, it looks bad.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webinars&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of giving webinars, it&amp;rsquo;s like doing a conference presentation, only
with
waaaaay more real-time viewers and almost zero real-time feedback. It&amp;rsquo;s like talking into the
void.  Some people like giving webinars precisely because they CAN&amp;rsquo;T see the audience.  I used
to hate them because the lack of feedback is very unnerving, but with practice (like anything)
I&amp;rsquo;ve become more comfortable with them.  I probably give maybe 3 public webinars a year (like my
upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/03/live-webinar-java-10-and-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;webinar on Java 10&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe 6 or so private ones a year.  These numbers may be
totally incorrect, but that&amp;rsquo;s what it feels like.  The public webinars are frequently one of my
conference talks just presented online, the private ones are less formal/practiced and may be
something like a short-ish live demo (10-20 mins) followed by questions and further
customer-driven demos (i.e. &amp;ldquo;can you show me how you&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screencasts&lt;/em&gt;. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done any screencasts before I came to JetBrains and they&amp;rsquo;re a totally
different skillset.  Not only do you have to learn how to use a brand new tool (I use Camtasia)
that requires a set of skills you probably don&amp;rsquo;t have already (i.e. video editing), but putting
together a 5 minute video of features is a VERY different thing to taking 40-60 minutes exploring
a concept in real-time with an audience. You have to work out up-front what it is you&amp;rsquo;re trying
to demo, figure out a sensible real-world use case for it, and then record the video and
narration that effectively shows this to users. I record those two things separately and edit
them together, others like to record the whole lot together. Because this area in particular is
one where probably most of the team was new to the skills needed, we&amp;rsquo;ve shared our knowledge a
few times here to try and improve ourselves and to try to get some consistency in approach. I
quite like doing screencasts because they&amp;rsquo;re a good way to poke at particular features in a tool,
and I like finding the use case that makes the feature make sense. But they can be quite a lot
of work. A screencast like my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/szlAxgchyXU&#34;&gt;VCS features in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.1&lt;/a&gt; can take less than a day
to
put together (most of which is editing), because this is an area of the tool I know well, and I
have a lot of example projects that showcase different use cases of Git workflows.  A
screencast on Spring features is more likely to take 2 or more days, most of which is locating
the right sort of code example that shows the features. It&amp;rsquo;s an area of the tool I haven&amp;rsquo;t used
much in a real development environment, a framework I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with but again don&amp;rsquo;t use
much, and also a framework that moves very rapidly, so I spend a lot of time getting up to
speed on the new parts of the framework and finding examples.  Screencasts generally fall into
two categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s New in {Product} {Version} (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZy-hmwOdEXtJTNC65GCuw8f7sR13UK9&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZy-hmwOdEXdOtXdFzyx_XCnrF_oD2Ft&#34;&gt;general tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blogging&lt;/em&gt;. I love writing. It&amp;rsquo;s what got me into this. It&amp;rsquo;s why this blog post is SO much
longer than it really ought to be. For JetBrains I blog about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New releases/features for IntelliJ IDEA and Upsource (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/12/intellij-idea-2017-3-debugger-improvements/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3: Debugger
Improvements&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics related to the tool but aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily features of the tool (e.g.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/code-smells/&#34;&gt;Code Smells&lt;/a&gt; for
IntelliJ IDEA, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/tag/code-review-workflows/&#34;&gt;Code Review Processes&lt;/a&gt; for Upsource)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specific topic that&amp;rsquo;s relevant to readers of the blog that either is relevant at a
particular time (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/09/java-9-and-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;Java 9 and IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;), or is something I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered myself
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/10/creating-multi-release-jar-files-in-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;Creating Multi-Release JAR Files in IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;) or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/&#34;&gt;Annotated monthly&lt;/a&gt;: takes me a day every
month to put together the newsletter, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it as it forces me to stay up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or sometimes something that I think is interesting or cool and is vaguely
development-/Java-related.
I probably average 1-2 blog posts a month.  Probably not that much actually, it depends a lot on my travel and other workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;. I have access to Tweet on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intellijidea&#34;&gt;intellijidea&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/upsource_jb&#34;&gt;upsource_jb&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one behind
those handles though. I post links to the videos, blog posts and other content I produce, and I
also create content for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DriveToDevelop?src=hash&#34;&gt;Twitter Tips&lt;/a&gt;
for both of those products. I use Camtasia to record
short videos and convert them to GIFs.  The most painful part of this process is thinking of
something interesting to Tweet about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;em&gt;Tweet from my own personal account&lt;/em&gt;. As I have gained more followers I have been more
and more careful/restrained about what I Tweet from there. I recently realised these days I
retweet a lot and occasionally tweet things I think are interesting to developers. I spend less
and less time ranting on there or making personal observations, although I would quite like to
bring back a more personal element to my Tweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretically I also &lt;em&gt;answer questions via
Twitter/&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/users/653519/trisha&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;/other social media&lt;/em&gt; about
our
tools.  I don&amp;rsquo;t get around to doing this very often, I should work it into my schedule/routine,
but sometimes I find it takes a disproportionally long time to replicate a problem and work out a
fix, by which time someone else has already answered or the original user has worked it out. If
someone addresses me directly I always try to respond, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just to ask someone to file
a ticket in YouTrack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Admin&lt;/em&gt;.  I actually have to do quite a lot of mundane admin stuff.  Part of it might be because
of my particular perfectionism, part of it might be because my situation really does require it.
For example, I have to book my own travel for a lot of the conferences, usually this means
flights and accommodation. I tried a travel agent for this, but I found a lot of the
complications were not around the actual booking process, but coordinating with everyone (my
family included) which times/days work best, am I bringing the family, am I going to do customer
visits, which customers might want to see me, when works for them etc. Also since I&amp;rsquo;m
travelling from Seville, we do have an airport but I&amp;rsquo;m very limited for flight choices, which
always bites me even though it&amp;rsquo;s five years since I was spoiled by living in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are the advocates organised at JetBrains?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at MongoDB, the Advocates were engineers who spent most of
their time working on language drivers for the database and some of their time blogging and
speaking at conferences.  At JetBrains, the Advocate position is a full time job doing the
advocacy stuff. We don&amp;rsquo;t report to engineering, we don&amp;rsquo;t report to marketing, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadi-hariri-b0368a83/&#34;&gt;Boss Person&lt;/a&gt; reports directly to the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advocates all belong to the same team, but each advocate has their own product(s) and
specialties.  In terms of co-ordinating what we&amp;rsquo;re actually going to work on, we talk to the PMMs
 (Product Marketing Managers) for our product and they&amp;rsquo;ll let us know what they need from us.
 Each PMM and each product is different, so they have different interests/focuses/plans.  With
 IntelliJ IDEA I spend quite a lot of time working with the PMM on each of the 3 releases a year,
 and most of the rest of the content is driven by me: it&amp;rsquo;s either connected to something else I&amp;rsquo;m
  working on (like one of my conference talks) or a Java release or something. Working in this
  way is quite familiar if you&amp;rsquo;ve been a consultant: in this model, the PMM is basically my
  customer and not my manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, our team is almost entirely remote. The JetBrains development teams are based in St
Petersburg and Munich, which means that those of us on a European timezone have an easier time of
 it. Our American team members tend to be dragged out of bed earlier than they would probably
 like in order to dial in to meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I still code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. I don&amp;rsquo;t write enterprise code any more, and I don&amp;rsquo;t write code that goes into the
IntelliJ IDEA codebase.  I do, however, spend a good chunk of the year creating projects that
demonstrate particular things, and live-coding within these projects.  I also occasionally still
contribute to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia&#34;&gt;Morphia&lt;/a&gt;, although mostly I use that as an
example code base to demo various things
- I love the Morphia code because it&amp;rsquo;s real lived-in code that is very similar to the sort of
code that real developers will be working with, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a nice clean toy project that bears
 zero resemblance to real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time coding, but every now and then I will devote a day
or two (or sometimes a week or two) to playing with something to scratch that itch.  This is
often used in blog posts or demos but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s enough just to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I need to learn on the job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been doing advocacy before I got to JetBrains, but there were still plenty of things I
needed to learn or level-up when I got here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screencasts: I had zero experience here, and I struggled to begin with. But then the whole
team had a number of discussions about how we did them. At first I was scared to talk about
didn&amp;rsquo;t know or what I was struggling with, but I found that when I opened up (both on Slack and
during one of our annual actual-face-to-face get togethers) about my pain points, I found a)
lots of the others struggle too and b) some people had answers that worked for me.  Also c)
turned out I knew things other people didn&amp;rsquo;t know, and that gave me a big confidence boost. A
lot of this is now documented on Confluence, so new people won&amp;rsquo;t have to struggle as much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webinars: I&amp;rsquo;d done two at MongoDB and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like them.  For the first year at
JetBrains I still didn&amp;rsquo;t really like them, but we gather feedback from attendees and on the
whole people liked my webinars, and those that didn&amp;rsquo;t usually gave constructive feedback, so I
gained confidence and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve improved in this area too.  Also, it became clear I
absolutely had to pay a lot more for my home internet connection, since the major complaint was
always that my sound would frequently cut out or get out of sync. Now I have faster internet and
it&amp;rsquo;s made my (work) life all round much better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self management: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked a lot at &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; enterprises, where there&amp;rsquo;s a clear chain of
command.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked for consultancies, where customers have clear expectations of you.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at startups, at one of which my manager liked to micromanage everyone, down to the
lines of code they wrote. JetBrains is not like any of those.  It is genuinely a flat
organisation (as I mentioned above, there&amp;rsquo;s very little management between me and the head boss
person), and people are given the freedom to work on what they want to, more or less however
they want to.  This can be quite a change if you&amp;rsquo;re used to formal management.  It&amp;rsquo;s even more
difficult when you&amp;rsquo;re remote, because you have to speak to a lot of individuals to figure out
what&amp;rsquo;s happening when where and how.  On the plus side, you&amp;rsquo;re trusted to get on with your job
(and expected to ask for help and support when you need it).  Self management is a skill, and
not everyone likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much travel is involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 5 years of doing advocacy I have been to quite a lot of conferences.  Every year I
say I&amp;rsquo;ll do less, and every year I end up doing much more than I expected/wanted. Last year I &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo;
did 7 events, and I was unable fly/on maternity leave for nearly 3 months.  That&amp;rsquo;s slightly more
than the one-every-other-month I wanted to do, but quite a bit less than previous years.  This year
I&amp;rsquo;m currently signed up for only two conferences, I expect that to at least double by the end of
the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone travels as much as me though, many of the other advocates only do a couple a year.&lt;br /&gt;
This is something that is more or less up to you, although there are a couple of big conferences
through the year (for me at least) that are about as close to mandatory for me to attend as is
possible in this self-managed environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect our technical writers won&amp;rsquo;t have to travel at all, except perhaps occasionally to the
office to connect with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s it like working remotely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit everyone.  And there&amp;rsquo;s a skill to it too.  I tend to like to work
 10ish-6ish because if I don&amp;rsquo;t work normal office hours I&amp;rsquo;m worried I won&amp;rsquo;t be doing enough. I
 also track how much time I spend on things, mostly to see where all my time is spent on those
 weeks where I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JetBrains uses Slack a lot, so us remote people do have a direct line to what&amp;rsquo;s going on, even
into the teams that are all sat together in an office.  The Developer Advocates have our own
Slack channel, of course, and that tends to be full of &amp;ldquo;witty banter&amp;rdquo; / water cooler conversation
.  It&amp;rsquo;s also the first place I go to ask questions about anything, and I&amp;rsquo;m no longer scared of
looking stupid if I ask a &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;/post/adjusting_to_working_remotely&#34;&gt;worked remotely in the past&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s better here than
other places because JetBrains
understands there are remote workers and that we have rights and needs. It&amp;rsquo;s also good for me
because I&amp;rsquo;m in Europe, so although I&amp;rsquo;m physically separate at least I don&amp;rsquo;t have the
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/tales_from_the_other_side_confessions_of_an_offshore_resource/&#34;&gt;timezone problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is great for flexibility, of course.  And although I do try to work 10-6ish, in
my office upstairs where the children can&amp;rsquo;t get to me, I am around if one of them needs me
immediately. I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a commute, so my hours are a lot shorter than if I worked (for
example) in London. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I could have gone back to work after just 4 months of
maternity leave if I had to work in an office - I&amp;rsquo;m still breastfeeding and this would have been
impossible if I didn&amp;rsquo;t work from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this has its pros and cons, working at home also comes with distractions (although it&amp;rsquo;s
 nice to be able to get the laundry done throughout the week rather than have to do it all at the
  weekend). Pros: a good excuse for a nice computer and exactly the desk / chair / office setup
  you want; close to the family and much more available than in an office. Cons: can be quite
  isolated, can be easily distracted, can be quite noisy (currently both the 5-month-old and the
  two-year-old are crying: is OK to be writing a blog now, would be a terrible time to record a
  screencast).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote working is a big topic of its own.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve done it before, you know the deal.  And
JetBrains is better than most places because they recognise us as real workers. But also probably
 because the whole team is remote, so it&amp;rsquo;s not just one or two people cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of working on an employee handbook which will help us remote people a lot
too, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of knowledge stored in people&amp;rsquo;s brains that isn&amp;rsquo;t documented anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the team like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a dozen or so advocates on the team, all with different technology backgrounds and
covering different tools.  Hadi and Svetlana cover Kotlin, which also tends to overlap with
IntelliJ IDEA. I do IntelliJ IDEA (I guess I&amp;rsquo;m the main IDEA advocate, I do all the release
material etc) and I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who really does Upsource, and have so far been nearly 100%
Java-the-language. Anton does TeamCity and because he&amp;rsquo;s Java &amp;amp; Kotlin there&amp;rsquo;s some overlap there
with IntelliJ IDEA.  Other team members cover C++, Python, Go, .NET, Web technologies (this last
is an area we&amp;rsquo;re looking for specific expertise) and related tools (Resharper, Rider, GoLand,
CLion, PyCharm, WebStorm) and I have probably forgotten a load of them too. I see us as
individuals doing a similar job but with surprisingly little overlap. This is one reason being
remote actually works for us, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to co-ordinate much. But we are trying to get better
at reusing stuff between tools, and/or taking other people&amp;rsquo;s ideas and content and reworking it
for our communities (for example, I stole a load of Paul&amp;rsquo;s PyCharm tip tweets and did them for
IntelliJ IDEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average age of the team is somewhere up in the late thirties.  I myself am just about to
cross into the 40s - eeeek!  We&amp;rsquo;re all experienced developers with an interest in our
technologies.  We&amp;rsquo;re laid back and passionate, which sounds like a weird combination but works
well for us. There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question in our team, and even though we don&amp;rsquo;t
work super closely on everything, we all support each other and do our best to make the team
happy and productive.  We definitely have room for improvement for working together (Gary and I
had fun recording our &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/o-2fvj7GsOQ&#34;&gt;series of Git videos&lt;/a&gt; but we haven&amp;rsquo;t managed
 to do anything similar since)
but it&amp;rsquo;s not because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the good parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking my own code projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning new technologies and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where I live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the bad parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having enough time to code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning new technologies and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep.  The plus sides are also the downsides.  I probably don&amp;rsquo;t have to explain why, but if anyone
 is interested in the specifics drop a note in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we looking for in a developer advocate / technical writer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all sparked by our need to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains .com/company/jobs/&#34;&gt;hire a couple of people&lt;/a&gt;, and wanting to be really transparent
 about what the role was like, ideally to attract people who might not have considered this role
 for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JetBrains is currently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/company/jobs/&#34;&gt;hiring a bunch of people&lt;/a&gt;, but the two roles that
sparked this whole
conversation are a Web Technologies Developer Advocate and an Engineering Technical Writer. I&amp;rsquo;m
not the one making the hiring decisions, and on top of that there&amp;rsquo;s no real hard and fast rules
about what makes a good hire into these roles, but I think these things are interesting to
us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you will have at least 10 years of experience as a developer. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have
been an architect/tech lead or other &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; role, but you do need to have a very good
understanding of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a developer, what the pain points are for people in this
role, how developers use technology and how they learn it.  In our
writing / presentations / screencasts we try to present information in a way that makes
developers awesome at their jobs (see Kathy Sierra&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2EdyIOH&#34;&gt;Badass: Making Users Awesome&lt;/a&gt;), which means our content is usually
pretty technical and targeted at developers.  Having a good chunk of experience as a developer
makes this substantially easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use our tools. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for anyone to learn on the job.  As developers this is
pretty much all we do.  But it&amp;rsquo;s going to be much easier for you to talk about how our tools make
developer&amp;rsquo;s lives easier / improve people&amp;rsquo;s productivity if you&amp;rsquo;ve actually used the tools in
real life,
have really felt their benefits, and have a good enough understanding of how to use
them to look like a power user (at least in the context you&amp;rsquo;ll be showing them). You don&amp;rsquo;t have
to have used all of our tools all of the time, but to be a developer advocate of a particular
IDE, you really should have used that IDE to code in the day job and have used it as more than
just a text editor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you&amp;rsquo;ll have some public profile that demonstrates you are not only interested in some
technology community (ideally the one we&amp;rsquo;re hiring for, e.g. web technologies) but are active in
that community.  We&amp;rsquo;re not looking for Rock Star Ninja Fully-Established Famous Developers.  But
this role is very much about being visible to developers, so it would be nice to see that you are
capable of interacting with other techies in a community.  What do I mean by this? I mean you
don&amp;rsquo;t have to have tens of thousands of followers on Twitter &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; thousands of points on
StackOverflow &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have been speaking at conferences for years &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; be the leader of a user
group &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have an established blog &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have written a book. What we would like to see though
is maybe one (or more) of the following:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have presented at a conference (ideally with a video so we can see your style)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active involvement in User Group(s) - e.g. organiser, regular presenter, active on mailing
list etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a technical blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a profile on StackOverflow which demonstrates the ability to provide valuable answers to
questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a GitHub (or similar) profile which showcases involvement in open source code and/or has
demo projects / code that other developers have found useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a Twitter profile that shows an interest in relevant technologies, and that you post
content that&amp;rsquo;s valuable to other developers (e.g. re-tweeting/linking to interesting content)
To re-iterate: we&amp;rsquo;re not looking for you to have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these things, and there may be other
types of public (or public-ish) activity which is just as good.  The key point is that you are
involved in the technical community outside of the day job and that you have demonstrated that
you give back to this community in some way&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Related to point three, you have to be able to demonstrate truly excellent communication
skills.  I have been involved in hiring developers at all sorts of organisations, and
communication skills is always seen as an important part of the role.  But for a role like this,
the job is almost entirely about communicating to people: to developers / architects / even
management about why and how to use our tools, and between you and the product marketing managers
for
the tool you&amp;rsquo;re the advocate for (more on that above).  Add to that the fact that we are
largely remote, it&amp;rsquo;s that much more difficult both to express what we mean to our colleagues and
to get a feel for what our colleagues are trying to tell us. You need to be able to communicate
potentially very technical ideas to other techies, you may need to be able to understand process
and talk about how a tool fits into a process (or what process works for a tool set), you need to
be able to work out with potentially multiple stakeholders what your priorities are and talk
honestly to set expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to be self-managed.  Our boss is the busiest man I know, and he really doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to
manage people.  He wants us to get on with our job, talking directly to the right people (like
the PMM, or the developers who worked on a specific feature) and only come to him when he&amp;rsquo;s
needed to unblock something.  This is another reason why the team is generally staffed with very
experienced people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call to women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, so, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to do this because I hate trying to suggest that different
genders have different needs by singling out a particular gender. I also have found that my
advice &amp;ldquo;for women&amp;rdquo; works really well for almost everyone anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do very specifically want to talk to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; if you are a woman developer (or other minority,
 but I can only speak from my experience of being a woman) and are even vaguely interested in
 developer advocacy as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think you maybe could do this, but you&amp;rsquo;re not ready yet, you probably are ready. For
every time you&amp;rsquo;ve thought you couldn&amp;rsquo;t present at a conference, think of those talks you&amp;rsquo;ve seen
where you&amp;rsquo;ve though &amp;ldquo;I could do that. I could do better than that.&amp;rdquo;. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be
perfect straight away and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be better than everyone immediately. You simply
have to be good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You already have the skills you need for managing the social media side of this job.  I had an
excellent question last week on Twitter about how I handle the fact that my Twitter feed is
effectively a public representation of JetBrains as a company. And I realised I don&amp;rsquo;t freak out
about this - partly because JetBrains is really cool about &amp;ldquo;the voice&amp;rdquo; of the company and is
happy to have us just being ourselves, but mostly because as a woman, particularly a woman
developer, I am already super-conscious of what I post, how I word things, how I appear on
social media. Doing this as a job required almost zero adjustment for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My experience in the Java/JVM community has shown me being a woman is a massive advantage for
things like getting in to speak at conferences.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the programme committee for a
couple of conferences, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the CFPs generally dominated by submissions from men. We&amp;rsquo;ve
actively looked for those from women and generally said &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to them unless there was a
compelling reason not to.  You will often get emails from conference organisers saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d
really love for you to submit to this conference because we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough women speakers&amp;rdquo;,
and while that particular approach makes me roll my eyes (what, you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the
content, you just care about my vagina?) it is something you can use to your advantage.  And to
be fair, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t invite you if you were crap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about being taken seriously as a developer when you&amp;rsquo;re a woman, I can tell
you from my own personal experience that being semi-famous in this space has reduced the number
of &amp;ldquo;are you a real developer?&amp;rdquo; questions at conferences and events to zero. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got
&amp;ldquo;speaker&amp;rdquo; on your lanyard, if you&amp;rsquo;ve just given a live demo showing you can code, you no longer
have to prove yourself to anyone, it&amp;rsquo;s out there for everyone to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to draw attention to this side of things because I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to worry about
it if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t already thought about it, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that I was scared of right at the
beginning: I was worried I might get shit over Twitter or on the blog for being a woman.  So far
(fingers crossed) I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the sort of thing I was afraid of. I do get mansplained at
sometimes, and I do have to respond to idiots on Twitter.  But a) I see my (white, male)
colleagues suffering the same thing all the time and b) my team, JetBrains and even my Twitter
followers etc have my back.  I have a support network.  The fear is still real though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are more of us doing this job, there will be fewer people looking at the single woman
developer thinking she represents all women developers.  If half a dozen women&amp;rsquo;s voices are out
there, it becomes clearer we don&amp;rsquo;t all want the same things or work the same way, And That&amp;rsquo;s OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a woman developer and are considering applying for this role, I urge you to please
apply.  And if you have any questions, queries, doubts etc, please do contact me directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d really love to see more applications from women developers. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say we discourage
or dislike applications from men or that we&amp;rsquo;ll reject you if you&amp;rsquo;re not female, but if you are a
woman developer and are even marginally interested in this role, please, please go for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s not generous at all, it&amp;rsquo;s totally self-serving for JetBrains since we&amp;rsquo;re trying
 to hire
developer advocates and technical writers&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I was a power user of IntelliJ IDEA, and I had done live coding demos with it in the
past when I joined, and that was probably a large part of why I was hired.  However, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used
Upsource or TeamCity before I came to JetBrains and I have done advocacy for both
tools, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert in all JB tools. But the fact that I
had used other code review tools before and felt a LOT of pain while using them made Upsource a
joy to advocate, since it fixes so many of the pain points I&amp;rsquo;ve felt with other tools.  And the
fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in Continuous Delivery environments, and had experience with Jenkins, also
made it easier for me to see where TeamCity fits, what it does well, why you might use it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Now I have children I seriously appreciate that physically getting out to user group
events or
conferences is very challenging for developers who are parents.  That&amp;rsquo;s why this list also includes
things which are a little easier to do on what can laughably be called the &amp;ldquo;spare time&amp;rdquo; when the
children aren&amp;rsquo;t demanding 100% of your attention, e.g. blogs/Twitter/StackOverflow/mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Can Men Do</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_can_men_do/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2016 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_can_men_do/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote a long email to the London Java Community in answer to an excellent question: &amp;ldquo;What can men do to support Women in Technology?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a brain dump, by no means comprehensive, and is in answer to a specific question in a specific context, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked
to make the information public so it can be useful in a broader context.  So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know one of the reasons men feel strongly about this topic is because they do want to help and don&amp;rsquo;t always know how, and can feel
excluded when it&amp;rsquo;s just presented as a women&amp;rsquo;s issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said in the past, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; was the community that mentored me, and those mentors
were largely men: Barry, Martijn, Ben Evans, John Stevenson to name a few. These guys were not only open and friendly and willing to
listen to me, they pushed me (hard!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the answers, of course, and there are lots of blogs and articles on the internet about this topic (if anyone finds any
they like, feel free to post as a comment for all to see), but for me personally, my male mentors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listened&lt;/em&gt; to me, and made me feel like I had a valid opinion.  They took things I said, assumed they were a valid hypothesis, and
made changes based on what I&amp;rsquo;d said.  I never felt like I had to change myself to fit in to the community.  Barry etc added different
types of events and different approaches to running events in order to accommodate feedback I&amp;rsquo;d given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pushed&lt;/em&gt; me - Barry included me in the Associates, simultaneously recognising my value to the community but also forcing me to be
more active in running it and applying changes I thought were important.  Martijn and Ben practically forced me to give short
presentations at the LJC well before I was ready. But they also gave me loads of support, suggesting topics, checking through my slides
in advance, giving me presentation hints and tips when I asked for them. They were right, I was ready, even when I felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
I&amp;rsquo;ve talked before about &lt;a href=&#34;becoming_an_evangelist&#34;&gt;how this helped my career&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Validated&lt;/em&gt; me - By co-presenting with me, these men who were more well known (maybe even respected ;) ) in the community (not just
the LJC, but the global Java Community) not only gave me support to launch my own presenting career, but they also validated, there on
stage, that I was someone to listen to.  Martin Thompson, Todd Montgomery, Dan North, as well as those I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned have all gone out
of their way to co-present with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in answer to the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re interested in supporting a Women in [some technology] group specifically, please do reach out to the organiser. Check what 
 the goals are for the community, and offer support.&lt;/li&gt;  
 &lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re interested in supporting women in technology generally (or specific women you know), read the following points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;: When you see a woman at a technical event (community, conference, etc) &lt;em&gt;assume she&amp;rsquo;s a techie&lt;/em&gt;.  I cannot tell
you
the number of times a man I was talking to at an LJC event assumed I was a recruiter or in HR because I was female.  It is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; better to
assume the woman is a techie and be corrected if she is not, than to assume the other way around.  And, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; assume she is a
competent, senior techie.  Again, much better for a student to correct you and tell you she&amp;rsquo;s junior, than for you to assume a seasoned
architect is junior just because she&amp;rsquo;s female.  This is by far the easiest thing for you to change in your behaviour, and probably the
most valuable thing you can do for the community to encourage women to simply turn up and keep turning up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know someone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in presenting, suggest she co-presents with you at a User Group event, internal company brown
bag, community conference, etc.  This is a great way to get started.  Or suggest she does a lightning talk at a User Group (some
conferences also offer Quickies for inexperienced speakers). If your local user group doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently do lightning talks, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they
can be started if there&amp;rsquo;s interest.  If you have the expertise, offer to check slides, and/or be there for a run-though of the talk
in advance.  This can even be over Skype or hangouts, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to take loads of time to travel to meet in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know women who you think would be great at writing, but who haven&amp;rsquo;t started their own blog yet, offer a place for them to write
for/with you. If you have a blog, they can write a guest post for you.  Again, offer to check the content before it goes live.  All of us
are super nervous about our stuff being &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;, receiving the green light from someone else is a nice confidence boost and helps
us feel better about publishing something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentor a woman. This is for anyone, male, female, non-gender-specific. Mentoring includes some of the activities mentioned above. Or
it can be something more code-focused.  Or helping them learn to play the politics of career (and believe me, techie roles and
companies are still full of politics, especially if you want to get promoted). In fact, I recently read that what&amp;rsquo;s really needed for
women is Sponsorship, not Mentoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;male mentors tend to sponsor rather than just mentor—similar to the difference between coaching
and selling. In fact&amp;hellip; women may actually be over-mentored, but under-sponsored. And that sponsoring—advocating to get somebody a job
or promotion, mentioning their name in an appointments meeting, actively helping that person advance—is what makes the real difference
in women helping women get ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/peggydrexler/2014/03/04/can-women-succeed-without-a-mentor/#513dc3b542f6&#34;&gt;Forbes: Can Women Succeed Without A Mentor?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  You have to be senior and visible (either in the community or in your organisation) to sponsor, but it makes a big difference to women&amp;rsquo;s
careers. I remember the one time I had a male sponsor in one of my jobs is the only time I got a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just be encouraging.  And while I personally have a real problem with being encouraging without sounding patronising (I dunno how to
say something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound patronising!), it&amp;rsquo;s really important you try to be positive without being patronising or mentioning
something gender related.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard comments like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120409030606/http://www.thedeveloperday.com/my-top-5-qcon-london-2012-talks/&#34;&gt;it would be enough to say this talk was delivered by a beautiful lady packed with a
room of geeks but it deserves more praise&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
(er, thanks?) and &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s so great to hear women give technical
presentations!&amp;ldquo;.  Hmm. I know that&amp;rsquo;s trying to be supportive but it does make you feel a bit&amp;hellip; like an outsider, some sort of weird zoo
animal. So, before you open your mouth, This One Simple Trick Can Save You From Embarrassment: would you say this to a man? If it would
sound silly aimed at a male, re-phrase it until it sounds sensible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in a position to give feedback (e.g. at work a direct report, 360 reviews, or in the community someone who requests
feedback), give actionable feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that women receive more &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/04/research-vague-feedback-is-holding-women-back&#34;&gt;vague feedback&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://fortune.com/2014/08/26/performance-review-gender-bias/&#34;&gt;personality criticism&lt;/a&gt; in
performance evaluations, whereas men receive actionable advice tied to business outcomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/the-real-reason-women-quit-tech-and-how-to-address-it-6dfb606929fd#.a1hn4ztpy&#34;&gt;The Real Reason Women Quit Tech And How To Address It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you can imagine, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to improve with clear, actionable advice than with vague feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really importantly, if a woman enjoys being technical, encourage her to stay technical.  Just because she has people skills as well doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean she should be promoted away from code to management, or moved into a Scrum Master position.  Just because she&amp;rsquo;s a woman presenting or writing about technology, does not mean she wants to present or write about being a woman in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far&amp;hellip;. well done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do all these things.  But if you do care about diversity (and in my experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve met more white men who care about
 diversity than women who care about it, cos being a minority is sometimes helpful), read these and do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s just
 that thing of assuming a woman you meet at a tech event is, in fact, a techie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS if you are a woman in technology and want to ask me anything, please feel free to drop me a line at any time. I have HORRIBLE e-mail
latency but I will answer you eventually :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaZone 2016</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javazone_2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2016 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javazone_2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a conference write up.  The short version of &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; is because I got a bit bored of doing it.  Plus, I
found I was attending conferences as a speaker &amp;ldquo;on the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and my experience of hanging out, catching up with my friends, chatting
 to other attendees to see what they&amp;rsquo;re up to and so forth, didn&amp;rsquo;t seem as useful to share with people who might want to find out
 whether a conference is worth attending from a content or atmosphere point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel compelled to blog about &lt;a href=&#34;https://2016.javazone.no/&#34;&gt;JavaZone&lt;/a&gt;. I presented there back in &lt;a href=&#34;/post/javazone_oslo&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, but every year since then haven&amp;rsquo;t
made it for one reason or another (the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s near my birthday in no way impacts my scheduling…).  I made the effort this year, and
I&amp;rsquo;m so pleased.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve been to many more conferences, of various sizes, various themes, all around the world, and I can definitely
state that JavaZone is up there as one of the best conferences around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content is great, JavaZone manages to attract a lot of great speakers who can present on topics that range from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/181814364&#34;&gt;deeply
technical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/181925281&#34;&gt;more theoretical&lt;/a&gt; to concepts
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/182087729&#34;&gt;beyond just code and syntax&lt;/a&gt;.  They also really make an effort to encourage local presenters, and to offer
the option of lightning talks. I love this from the point of view of encouraging more from the community to get involved and present themselves, but also because you get more novel content - experience reports from developers deep in the trenches; teams who can tell you what they&amp;rsquo;ve found trying to implement things that we hear about at conferences; and other things from the point of view of real developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.45.36-coffee.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Food and fantastic coffee&#34; title=&#34;Food and fantastic coffee&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food is fantastic, and available all day.  I made half of a promise to myself not to rate conferences on the quality of the food
after I had a glimpse at how insanely hard it is for conference organisers to balance the requirements of keeping ticket costs low,
using an adequate venue in an accessible location, and providing some sort of catering through the day.  Especially when venues
themselves often restrict this.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how JavaZone do it, but now I&amp;rsquo;m aware of all these issues, I&amp;rsquo;m even more impressed at the
variety and quality of their food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.46.02-robots.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Robots&#34; title=&#34;Robots&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The venue.  The location in the centre of Oslo is nice, often conference venues are out of town, making them hard to get to or, if
you&amp;rsquo;re staying near there, terribly isolated.  One of the reasons to travel to a conference is to see the city, and you get a chance to
do that at JavaZone. So it&amp;rsquo;s central, easy to get to, with plenty of great hotels nearby.  The venue itself also nicely laid out, with
presentation rooms circling a central exhibition space.  Which leads me to&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 09.46.18-exhibition.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Exhibition&#34; title=&#34;The Exhibition&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exhibition space is brilliant.  Because it&amp;rsquo;s central, most people spend their time between sessions in the exhibition hall.  As
an exhibitor (JetBrains had a stand there), this is obviously useful to us, but as an attendee it’s nice to know there&amp;rsquo;s a place to go
to hang out where other people will also be hanging out.  Especially when the vibe of the hall was so much fun, so energetic.  And the
stands themselves were impressive: some bribing us with excellent coffee; several with lego areas inviting you to sit down and play;
interactive VR headsets; modern and retro gaming centres (curses, I forgot to take a photo); interactive quizzes and games… As for us,
we had a sofa, and I loved that, it felt welcoming and relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.45.20-games.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Games&#34; title=&#34;Exhibition&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is really friendly.  The crew and JUG people were easy to spot and friendly if you needed help. All attendees and speakers
were happy to strike up conversations short and long, on a variety of topics. People smiled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a big conference, there are a lot of attendees, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel big and daunting.  Instead, you get the benefit of 8 tracks
of varied content, but don&amp;rsquo;t feel lost in the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 09.39.20-overflow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Overflow Room&#34; title=&#34;Overflow Room&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overflow room is the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen at a conference, and I&amp;rsquo;m seriously wondering if I can set up something similar at
home (on a much smaller scale!) to let me skim content from multiple talks when I&amp;rsquo;m doing research, or maybe just something to have
half an eye on while I&amp;rsquo;m entertaining the minion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was, from my point of view as an attendee and speaker, incredibly well organised.  It felt smooth, and touches like the big
monitors flashing up relevant information was really nice.  I also loved that the video production quality and presentation of the
stages and so forth was really professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.46.36-stacks-coffee.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Plenty of caffeine for the developers&#34; title=&#34;Plenty of caffeine for the developers&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I personally think it&amp;rsquo;s brilliant that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/album/4133413&#34;&gt;videos are online&lt;/a&gt; really soon after you&amp;rsquo;ve presented.
Sometimes as a speaker you might want a delay on the video - conferences may be more likely to accept your talk if it&amp;rsquo;s not already widely available.  For me though,
especially when giving a new talk like we did here, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to see the video so soon afterwards, to see how it went and
learn from it.  For speakers just starting on their presenting career, it&amp;rsquo;s also great - you have a video to use in your &amp;ldquo;portfolio&amp;rdquo; to
help you get your talk(s) accepted at other conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I can&amp;rsquo;t leave this without mentioning diversity.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;m a world-weary veteran of conferences, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly blind to gender
balance unless I specifically look, or something out of the ordinary catches my attention.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the percentages were, but
I noticed so many women at the conference, women who were clearly professionals attending the conference and not hired booth babes or
staff of some other kind.  It was obvious and pleasing.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how the other women attendees felt, if it was their first
conference maybe they still noticed there were fewer women than men, but the difference to me was that whichever direction I looked
in, there was at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; woman, usually more. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there are more women developers in Up North, or if it&amp;rsquo;s just a
conference that somehow appeals more to women than other conferences. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to find out if any special measures were taken
by the conference organisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know a bit more about conferences and how they work behind the scenes, I&amp;rsquo;m astounded at JavaZone.  It feels like  a lot of money has been spent getting it really right, and/or they&amp;rsquo;ve worked really hard to get the absolute most out of what budget they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to really hunt for a downside, it&amp;rsquo;s that all the free alcohol was beer and not wine.  Yep, a complaint about free beer.  But knowing how expensive wine is in Norway, I&amp;rsquo;m not at all surprised.  Plus, moaning about the exact type of free alcohol available seems churlish at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 16.28.07-jetbrains.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The JatBrains stand&#34; title=&#34;The JetBrains stand&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do get a chance to go to JavaZone as an attendee or speaker, I highly recommend it.  I hope to be going again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested, we were presenting a new talk,
&lt;a href=&#34;presentation/code_review_matters_and_manners&#34;&gt;Code Review Matters and Manners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Year? Really?</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_a_year.md/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_a_year.md/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I came to the blog to update my &lt;a href=&#34;//presentation/upcoming_events/&#34;&gt;upcoming events&lt;/a&gt; (at least something stays up to date) only to find
it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly a year since I last blogged!  This is terrible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything in a year, it&amp;rsquo;s that a lot of my writing energy goes into
stuff for the actual day job.  Which is good, because that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what I wanted from the day job, but the blog makes it look like
I don&amp;rsquo;t write any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m going to cheat.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole series of articles off the back of last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/java8_in_anger/&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/a&gt; talk:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2015/10/30/five-java-8-features/&#34;&gt;Five Java 8 Features That You Won’t Be Able to Live Without&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/why-java-8-1&#34;&gt;Why Java 8?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-920950&#34;&gt;Java SE 8 in Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-test-driven-development.html&#34;&gt;TDD in IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;. I have video
clips to turn this into a screencast as well, but that&amp;rsquo;s Yet Another thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tutorial on how IntelliJ IDEA helps you &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-migrating-to-java-8.html&#34;&gt;migrate code to Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.  This evolved into the other thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this year, my latest live demo
presentation, &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/refactoring_to_java_8/&#34;&gt;Refactoring to Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole series of blog posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/category/practices/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;What to look for in a code review&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This was fun and satisfying to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;which got &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/whattolookforinacodereview&#34;&gt;turned into a book&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m finally the author of a book!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2016/07/java-8-top-tips/&#34;&gt;Java 8 Top Tips&lt;/a&gt;, with a bunch of IntelliJ-specific tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken over &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/&#34;&gt;Java Annotated Monthly&lt;/a&gt;, so at least you get to hear from me
once a month with that. I try really hard not to be too sarcastic, jokey or British when I write the newsletter. I don&amp;rsquo;t always succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a bunch of screencasts &amp;amp; webinars for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/intellijideavideo/videos&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUa50f13M4v5Nvp6b-IBNB4e&#34;&gt;Upsource
and Team City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and I had a baby.  I&amp;rsquo;m contemplating blogging about being a working parent, but I&amp;rsquo;m a bit concerned that Of Course a woman is
going to blog about Being A Mother, when previously I just blogged about&amp;hellip; well, come to think about it I blogged about all sorts of
things, including &lt;a href=&#34;/post/why_the_customer_isnt_always_right/&#34;&gt;haircuts&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/what_my_hangovers_can_teach_you_about_agile/&#34;&gt;hangovers&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess I could probably get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java 8 MOOC - Session 3 Summary</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session3/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the final get-together to discuss the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt;. Any
event hosted in August in a city that is regularly over 40&amp;deg;C is going to face challenges, so it was great that
we had attendees from earlier sessions plus new people too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/java8mooc/lesson3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woohoo lambdas!&#34; title=&#34;Woohoo lambdas!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this session was to talk about Lesson 3, but also to wrap up the course as a whole: to talk about what we
liked and what we would have improved (about both the course itself and our user group events).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous &lt;a href=&#34;/post/java_8_mooc_session1&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/post/java_8_mooc_session2&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, let&amp;rsquo;s outline our
discussion areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#findAny--&#34;&gt;findAny()&lt;/a&gt;
vs &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#findFirst--&#34;&gt;findFirst()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Why do we
need both of these methods, and when would you use them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;code&gt;findFirst()&lt;/code&gt; is the deterministic version, which will return you the first element in the Stream (according to
encounter order - see the section on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;Ordering in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;).
So, regardless of whether you run the operation in parallel or serial, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; and use &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt;
with this list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you&amp;rsquo;ll get the element at index 3 - the first &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;findAny()&lt;/code&gt; is non-deterministic, so will return you any element that matches your criteria - it could return the
element at index 3, or the one at position 6. Realistically, if the stream is on an ordered collection like a list,
when you run &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; on a sequential stream, I expect it will return the same result as &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt;.  The real
use-case for &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; is when you&amp;rsquo;re running this on a parallel stream. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the above list, and assume that
when you run this on a parallel stream it&amp;rsquo;s processed by two separate threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;,    // processed by thread 1 
 &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;]     // processed by thread 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible that thread 2 finds its &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; (the one at position 6) before thread 1 finds the one at position 3, so
this will be value that&amp;rsquo;s returned. By configuring the Stream to return any one of the values that matches the
criteria, you can potentially execute the operation faster when running in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; is (potentially) faster in parallel and (probably) returns the same value as &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; when running in
serial, why not use that all the time?  Well, there are times when you really do want the first item. If you have a
list of DVDs ordered by year the film was released, and you want to find the original &amp;ldquo;King Kong&amp;rdquo; (for
example), you&amp;rsquo;ll want &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; to find the one released in 1933, not the one that was released in 1976 or the
one from 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; is not always going to be slower than &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt;, even in parallel.  Going back to our list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;ldquo;H&amp;rdquo; could be the same performance for both methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collectors&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really see the big picture for collectors.  I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly content with
the built in collectors like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.toList())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.toSet())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see what they do, and work out when you need to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also very happy to have discovered &lt;code&gt;joining&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.joining(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a super-useful way to create Comma Separated Values (CSVs) that I use in my
&lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/java8_in_anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where things get a bit murky for me is where we start chaining up collectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.mapping(...).combiner().andThen(...).apply(...))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(it should be obvious from my lack of clear example that I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% certain under which circumstances these are
useful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a group, we think the chained collectors are kinda ugly - not because we&amp;rsquo;re against chaining (we like Streams),
but maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s another chain inside a param to a chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this is an area where some good, solid examples and a bit of daily use will make it much clearer to
developers. We hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this, the course didn&amp;rsquo;t go into creating your own collectors at all. My personal (under-informed) opinion
is that I guess most developers should be able to use either the out-of-the-box collectors (&lt;code&gt;toList&lt;/code&gt; etc) or use the
collector chaining to build what they need. If you need a custom collector, perhaps you haven&amp;rsquo;t considered everything
that&amp;rsquo;s already available to you. But as a group, we decided we would have liked to see this topic anyway so that we
could get a deeper understanding of what collectors are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercises for lesson 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Well. What can we say? I really hope there are people reading this who haven&amp;rsquo;t finished
the course yet, because the Sevilla Java User group would like to say to you: don&amp;rsquo;t despair, the lesson 3 exercises
are &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; harder than those for lessons 1 and 2. Honestly, the whole group considered it less of a learning
curve and more of a massive cliff to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://herbookthoughts.reads-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/d6a1143f571184db25f94613edd43b40af6d3a629221aba00d9efdcfef5efd84.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I have no idea what I am doing&#34; title=&#34;I have no idea 
what I am doing&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, it was great to have something so challenging to end on, but it probably would have been less ego-destroying
if we could have got up to that level gradually instead of having it sprung on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Part 2 of the lesson 3 exercises was that we had three very different answers to discuss
in the group. None of us were super happy with any of them, but we could see definite pros and cons of each approach,
and that&amp;rsquo;s something you really want to learn in a course like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also really great to have a rough performance test to run on your own computer, so that you could really see
the impact of your choices on the performance of the stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m going to add a shameless plug to a friend&amp;rsquo;s book here. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Java 8 for this course, for
my &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/java8_in_anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 demo&lt;/a&gt;, and to generally get up to speed. My favourite book for getting to
grips with lambdas and streams
is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J3B3J3C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00J3B3J3C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=IX6U2YT4FADY4JY6&#34;&gt;Java 8 Lambdas: Pragmatic Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00J3B3J3C&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;
by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RichardWarburto&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&lt;/a&gt;. This book also contains more info about collectors too,
so maybe some of our questions around how to use these in more complex situation are answered in here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We really enjoyed the MOOC, and the sessions to get together to discuss it. We particularly liked that the meetups
were a safe place to ask questions and discuss alternative solutions, and that we weren&amp;rsquo;t expected to be genius-level
experts in order to participate fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If/when Oracle re-runs the MOOC, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to take part this time I highly recommend signing up.
And if you can find (or run) a local meetup to discuss it, it makes the experience much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java 8 MOOC - Session 2 Summary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;/post/java_8_mooc_session1&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla Java User Group&lt;/a&gt;
is working towards completing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt; on
lambdas and streams. We&amp;rsquo;re running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/&#34;&gt;three sessions&lt;/a&gt;
to share knowledge between people who are doing the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second week&amp;rsquo;s lesson was about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; - how you can use the
new stream API to transform data. There was also a whole section on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/java8-optional-2175753.html&#34;&gt;Optional&lt;/a&gt;, which initially seemed like
rather a lot, but it turns out that &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; can do rather more than I originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meetup session, we talked about:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/java8-optional-2175753.html&#34;&gt;Optional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: we were pretty
comfortable,
I think, with using &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; to
prevent a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;. What we weren&amp;rsquo;t so clear on were the examples of
&lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; - if you were getting your &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; values from a stream, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you do the map and the
filter on the stream first? For example, why do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .findFirst()
    .map(String::trim)
    .filter(s -&amp;gt; s.length() &amp;gt; 0)
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you could map and filter in the stream to get the first non-empty value? That certainly seems like an
interesting question in relation to streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; being more useful when other APIs fully
support Java 8 and return &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; values, then you can perform additional operations on return values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That terminal operation&amp;rsquo;s not actually terminal??&lt;/strong&gt;: We ran into this a couple of times in our examples in the
session, one example is the code above (let&amp;rsquo;s copy it down here so we can look at it more closely):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .findFirst()
    .map(String::trim)
    .filter(s1 -&amp;gt; s1.length() &amp;gt; 0)
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;code&gt;findFirst()&lt;/code&gt; a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps&#34;&gt;terminal operation&lt;/a&gt;? How
can you carry on doing more operations on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is, of course, that the return type of the terminal operation can also lead to further operations.  The
above is actually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Optional&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; result = list.stream()
                              .findFirst();
result.map(String::trim)
      .filter(s1 -&amp;gt; s1.length() &amp;gt; 0)
      .ifPresent(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our terminal operation returns an optional, which allows you to do further operations. Another example of this
confusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .map(String::toLowerCase)
    .collect(toList())
    .forEach(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;collect()&lt;/code&gt; is a terminal operation, but it returns a list, which also allows &lt;code&gt;forEach()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; results = list.stream()
                           .map(String::toLowerCase)
                           .collect(toList());
results.forEach(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be aware that just because it&amp;rsquo;s called a terminal operation, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t perform other operations on
the returned value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel/sequential/parallel&lt;/strong&gt;: there had been a question in the previous week about why you could write code like
this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .parallel()
    .map(String::trim)
    .sequential()
    .filter(s1 -&amp;gt; s1.length() &amp;gt; 0)
    .parallel()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and whether that would let you dictate which sections of the stream were parallel and which were to be processed in
serial.  Lesson two set the lesson straight, declaring &amp;ldquo;the last operator wins&amp;rdquo; - meaning &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the above code will
be run as a parallel stream. I can&amp;rsquo;t find any documentation for this, I&amp;rsquo;ll edit this post if I locate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html#unordered--&#34;&gt;Unordered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Why
would you ever want your stream to be unordered?&amp;rdquo; - the answer is that &lt;code&gt;unordered()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/21350234/653519&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn
your sorted collection into one with no order&lt;/a&gt;, it just says that when
this code is executed, the order of elements doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.  This might make processing faster on a parallel stream,
but as a group we figured it would probably be pointless on a sequential stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency optimisations and order of stream operations&lt;/strong&gt;: We had a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; conversation about the order in which you
perform
operations in a stream. The MOOC (in fact, most documentation around Streams) tells us that a) streams are
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt;, and
not evaluated until a terminal operator is encountered and b) this enables optimisation of the operations in the
stream.  That lead to a discussion about the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .map(String::toLowerCase)
    .filter(s -&amp;gt; s.length() % 2 == 1)
    .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filter operation should result in less items to process in the stream. Given that the &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; operation doesn&amp;rsquo;t
change anything that &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; relies on, will this code be optimised somehow under the covers so that the filter
is actually executed first? Or are optimisations still going to respect the order of operations on a stream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our case is actually a very specific case, because a) the &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; returns the same type as the params passed in (i.e.
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t map a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) and b) the &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the characteristic the &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; is
looking at (i.e. length). But generally speaking, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect these conditions to be true - in fact I bet in a
large number of cases they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true. So pipeline operations are &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/22056258/653519&#34;&gt;performed in the order in which they are
written&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that our &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; will not be re-ordered into
a more efficient order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb seems to be to do filtering as early in the stream as possible - that way you can potentially
cut down the number of items you process in each step of the stream. Therefore our code would probably be better as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .filter(s -&amp;gt; s.length() % 2 == 1)
    .map(String::toLowerCase)
    .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Flat Map&lt;/strong&gt;: what&amp;hellip;?
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#flatMap-java.util.function.Function-&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;flatMap()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is one of those methods that makes total sense once you get the hang of it, and you don&amp;rsquo;t
understand why it was so confusing. But the first time you encounter it, it&amp;rsquo;s confusing - how is &lt;code&gt;flatMap()&lt;/code&gt;
different to &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; is used to squish (for example) a stream of streams into just a simple stream. It&amp;rsquo;s like turning a
2-dimensional array into a single dimension so that you can iterate over all the items without needing nested
for-loops. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/22384132/653519&#34;&gt;an example on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, and some more examples
in answer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26684562/java-8-map-and-flatmap-methods&#34;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparators&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;rsquo;ve probably all written comparators at some point, it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of those examples where we
really did use anonymous inner classes &amp;ldquo;in the olden days&amp;rdquo; and were looking forward to replacing them with lambdas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reader.lines()
      .sorted(new Comparator&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;() {
          @Override
          public int compare(String o1, String o2) {
              return ???;
          }
      })
      .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, using a lambda still doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer the question &amp;ldquo;do I minus o1 from o2, or o2 from o1?&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reader.lines()
      .sorted((o1, o2) -&amp;gt; ??? )
      .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s yet another new method in Java 8 here that can save us, one that is not nearly as well publicised as it
should be. There&amp;rsquo;s a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#comparing-java.util.function.Function-&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Comparator.comparing()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
that you can use to really easily define what to compare on. The JavaDoc and signature looks kinda confusing, but
this is one of those places where method references suddenly make loads of sense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reader.lines()
      .sorted(comparingInt(String::length))
      .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Here we&amp;rsquo;re actually using the &lt;code&gt;comparingInt&lt;/code&gt; method as we&amp;rsquo;re going to compare on a primitive value). Personally this
is one of my favourite new features in Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Join us next week for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223910762/&#34;&gt;last session on Java 8 - Lambdas and Streams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post for the JetBrains Upsource blog about some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2015/07/23/what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review/&#34;&gt;things you should be looking for when you do code
reviews&lt;/a&gt; (and some of the things
you should not be looking at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback in the comments for the post of things that you look for in code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java 8 MOOC - Session 1 Summary</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; is working together towards completing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt; on
lambdas and streams. As part of this, we&amp;rsquo;re running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/&#34;&gt;three sessions&lt;/a&gt;
during the course so we can, as a group, ask  questions about the lectures, get help with the homework, and (if we&amp;rsquo;re
feeling very smart!) help people who may be struggling (or might not have watched the videos).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we had the first session which went really well. We had a small-ish group, about half of whom had
completed the homework and the quiz (for the first lesson) and half had not. We worked through the homework exercises
together, saw how there were multiple solutions for each problem, and explored how to balance conciseness with
longer, more descriptive code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;First offline session for lesson 1 of the lambdas and streams mooc &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/java8?src=hash&#34;&gt;#java8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/40gradosAlaSombra?src=hash&#34;&gt;#40gradosAlaSombra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/hJgPrLl3C5&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJgPrLl3C5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; SVQ JUG (@SVQJUG) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SVQJUG/status/623199430158778368&#34;&gt;July 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole people thought the videos for the course were very clear and well-explained, although we also went
through how to run the videos at 1.5 speed, as most people wanted to run through them faster! I thought the pace of the
videos was especially good for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t so comfortable with listening in English, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to add
subtitles and speed it up if you feel comfortable with the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lesson covers lambdas, and their use in some of the new Java 8 methods (specifically on collections, but
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; streams).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas we discussed most, the ones that needed more clarity were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html&#34;&gt;Functional Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;:
what does &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-functional-1&#34;&gt;Single Abstract Method (SAM)&lt;/a&gt; really mean? Also, we
were interested in the &amp;ldquo;exception&amp;rdquo; of methods declared on &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; as well as an interface (e.g. &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;), but we
came
to the conclusion that it was easier to simply think of looking for only one method without any form of
implementation at all - methods defined on &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; must have an implementation, since &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is not an
abstract class or interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html&#34;&gt;Method References&lt;/a&gt;: we looked at
examples of the three types that aren&amp;rsquo;t constructor references, what they look like in lambda form and how they
differ. Method references are&amp;hellip; not difficult to understand, but do look a bit awkward in the code if you&amp;rsquo;re not
used to them, and can be confusing as all your types, parameters and return values disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallel execution: The first lesson talks a lot about how lambdas are here to make parallelisation and
concurrency easier for developers, so obviously there was a question about how the code in the homework examples would
be executed in a multi-CPU environment. I assumed (although I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for clarification) that methods like
&lt;code&gt;removeIf&lt;/code&gt; are not parallelised, since in the case of Streams you have to explicitly state you want to go parallel.
We also talked a bit about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html#parallel--&#34;&gt;parallel()&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#parallelStream--&#34;&gt;parallelStream()&lt;/a&gt;, even
though the lesson didn&amp;rsquo;t cover Streams at all. We wanted to understand a bit more about the pros and cons of going
parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also snuck in some demos of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; awesomeness, including
its magical support for creating lambdas and turning things into (and from) method references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/java8mooc/ReplaceWithMethodReferenceMac.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Converting code to Java 8&#34; title=&#34;Converting code to Java 8&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great, collaborative session, with most people getting a chance to demonstrate their code (if they wanted
to!). And at the end we had solutions to the five exercise problems and had discussed all the areas people wanted
more clarity on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at QCon New York (probably my business conference this year!) I was
interviewed by Ralph Winzinger for InfoQ. It felt like a short interview at the time,
but we covered a lot of ground - Java 8, Java vs other JVM languages, the effectiveness
of the JCP, and the future of Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video and the transcript are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-java-eco-system&#34;&gt;available on InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Path To Evangelism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I get asked a lot about how I got into technical advocacy /
evangelism&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,
so it seems like the most cost-effective way to answer this question is to
write a post about it. Warning: it&amp;rsquo;s a long one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me caveat this (I always have caveats, don&amp;rsquo;t I?) with, &amp;ldquo;this is
my personal experience&amp;rdquo;.  There may be other ways to get into this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any long-time readers of the blog (I love you guys!!) will
know that I started blogging before I did any of this
running-around-the-world-speaking-at-conferences lark.  I started blogging
for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even &amp;ldquo;back then&amp;rdquo; (probably around 2007), it was definitely an advantage to
have something external to the day job to differentiate you from other job
candidates.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable with open source, Stack Overflow
wasn&amp;rsquo;t invented yet (and even if it had been, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would have felt
knowledgeable enough to answer questions), and most of what I had learnt in
order to level-up my skills
was via blogs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/&#34;&gt;Rands in Repose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed writing. One of the (many) things I had wanted to be
&amp;ldquo;when I grew up&amp;rdquo; was a writer or a journalist. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take that path
because I thought if I did I would be Poor Forever.  However, if I started
practising my writing in a blog, I would learn to find my voice, and have
something to show book publishers if I ever did get around to writing a
book, like I had always wanted to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  you&amp;rsquo;ve ever started a blog, you know the problem is thinking of things to
write about. I generally documented things I&amp;rsquo;d had difficulty getting
working, because a) if I had trouble with the existing documentation, other
people would too and b) I have a memory like a goldfish, so it would be
useful for me if nothing else. But it took me years to really take the blog
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2008, I joined the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, largely
because I had returned to London from a year working in New York, and a) I needed a new job (during
the height of the crisis, when my recent experience was all financial
markets!) and b) although I had friends in London, I needed to rebuild my
social networks, and I was using meetup.com to do this. I tried lots of other
meetup groups, but like many geeks, I found it hard to connect to people
without the common ground of tech or code to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I ended up working for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and
because we were always looking
for keen, bright developers, I started getting much more involved in the LJC
so that I could help us hire people I actually wanted to work with. During
this time, people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jr0cket&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;
and, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bcrecworks&#34;&gt;Barry&lt;/a&gt; were
encouraging me, consciously or not, to do a bit of technical presenting. I saw
a lot of different talks there, some from professional evangelists from
vendors, but many from &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; developers like me. It made me think that
a) I should do this (awesome for your profile/career etc) and b) I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;
do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I saw very few women presenting (I do remember an
awesome presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fabianenardon&#34;&gt;Fabiane&lt;/a&gt;) and
also very few women members. Many members
assumed I was a recruiter, even before I started trying to chat to people
to, well, recruit them for LMAX. In the first 2 minutes of meeting someone,
if they didn&amp;rsquo;t ask me directly if I was in recruitment or HR, I would always
make it clear that I was a Java developer. It was tedious but something I
just got used to. Interestingly, once it was clear I was a Java person,
people seemed to accept that and just treat me like any other techie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the reasons I decided to start doing presentations - I
could a) show my own technical credentials, so I would spend less time having
these tiresome conversations (which, by the way, seems to have worked) and
b) make it more normal to see women techies, hopefully minimising the number
times other women faced the same assumptions (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this worked or
not, as I only have my own experiences to look at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these thoughts were only floating around my mind, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything.  During this time, while working at LMAX, it seemed like there were lots of
things I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; blog about, or talk about, but I never really got round to it.
Plus, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what I was allowed to talk about and what I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
talking about. So apparently during these two years I only wrote a total of 6
posts, and I never did a single presentation at the LJC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I really wanted to do presenting and have time/inspiration for the
blog, so I chose to leave LMAX and join
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; - they were looking for
consultants and I knew this was a company that valued blogging and
presenting, and I&amp;rsquo;d had some exposure to their guys through the LJC and,
years before, I&amp;rsquo;d seen them speaking at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-london.html&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;,
which had actually been my initial inspiration for blogging.
I told LMAX that was why I was leaving, and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s 2011, and I&amp;rsquo;ve joined ThoughtWorks. I revived the blog while I was
unassigned to a project, I invested that time in porting the blog to a
more sensible platform, and trying to write a blog a day. Again, I picked
topics I could comfortably talk about - I spoke about my experiences as a
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/my_experiences_with_android_development/&#34;&gt;beginner trying Android for the first
time&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes people will be arsey
with beginners, but in reality many real human beings can&amp;rsquo;t tell you you&amp;rsquo;re
wrong when you&amp;rsquo;re just talking about your own experiences), and despite my
original intent to blog with zero gender identity (I was genuinely afraid
that if I wrote about tech subjects and I was wrong, or very junior, I would
give women programmers a bad name) I decided to blog about &amp;ldquo;the women in
technology subject&amp;rdquo;. Again, here I went for my personal opinion/experiences,
for which only mean people can criticise you (mean people are easier to
ignore than correct people :) )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also fortunate enough to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;
in person while he was over
in London. We were talking over drinks (this is London, after all) about the
women in technology thing (ThoughtWorks are really big on this subject, and
determined to do something positive in this area), and I was complaining about
the lack of women at a particular conference. He asked me if I had submitted
a talk for the conference.  Me?? Of course not! I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for that! I&amp;rsquo;ve
got nothing to talk about. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been given permission to do this, or
guidance on how to do it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even presented at the user group yet. But
it did make me think - I said I wanted to present, so what was stopping me?
Did I need someone to guide me through it, to assign it to me as a task? It
was going to be up to me to make this happen. And if Martin Fowler, who
had just met me 5 minutes beforehand, thinks I&amp;rsquo;m ready to do this, then who&amp;rsquo;s
to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m not? What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course life then got in the way - I was assigned to a couple of projects,
so the blogging stopped. I was interested in attending or
speaking at conferences, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to have anything ThoughtWorksy to
talk about for quite a while. And now, because I was commuting to my assigned
project, I had very little time even for the LJC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, LMAX called
to let me know that the talk they&amp;rsquo;d done at QCon San Francisco,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to Do 100K TPS at Less than 1ms Latency&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had been
enormously popular, and they were open sourcing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to do
some evangelism around this - did I want to come back and help a) do
evangelism and b) co-ordinate the company&amp;rsquo;s evangelism?  Yes, yes I did. So,
after just 3 months, I quit TW and went back to LMAX&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at LMAX, I started to take evangelism more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to blog every week - I set aside Sundays for blogging (at the time
I was, fortunately for my particular choices, single and not overburdened
with a social life outside of the LJC). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to sit all alone in my
tiny flat, so I&amp;rsquo;d go to the pub with my shiny new Macbook Air, bought
specially for blogging (thanks ThoughtWorks, you spoiled me - I needed a mac
after I&amp;rsquo;d invested 3 months getting to grips with the one you gave me) and
write &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always amazing, but I&amp;rsquo;d do something. During the
week, when ideas came to me, I&amp;rsquo;d make a note of the title in the blogging
tool so that when Sunday came I&amp;rsquo;d pick one and go with it.  Early on it was
fairly easy - we&amp;rsquo;d released a white paper on the Disruptor, but I found it
hard to understand what it really meant, so I spent Sundays writing shorter
articles breaking down how it worked and how to use it. I needed a LOT of
help from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.real-logic.co.uk/about.html&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mikeb2701&#34;&gt;Mike
Barker&lt;/a&gt; to understand it, but they were patient
with me (plus I think they were happy that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; was writing this and it
didn&amp;rsquo;t
have to be them). They took the heavier, more complicated subjects and I
pitched my stuff at developers like myself. When I ran out of Disruptor
stuff, I moved on to the topics I had in the backlog - I generally had more
ideas for blogs than time to blog, so I ended up with quite a long list to
pick from. The key is to make a note of it at the time you think of it, and
not try and think of a topic when you sit down with time to blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coordinated our events and publicised them on the new LMAX blog I&amp;rsquo;d created.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davefarley77&#34;&gt;Dave Farley&lt;/a&gt; was often presenting on
something Continuous Delivery related since
&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1NyUQ53&#34;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; had been released, and Martin was talking
about hardcore concurrency stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike and I got even more involved in the LJC, not just to recruit people.  We
got involved in the JCP and OpenJDK - since LMAX was doing cutting edge
technology stuff with Java, we wanted to see where the language was going
and influence it too if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martijn must&amp;rsquo;ve got fed up my lack of drive in the presenting area, as he
pretty much forced me to do my first presentation.  In a
nice way! But he told me I was ready, he checked my content before I did it,
and I did a short talk on the JCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, my plan was to spend this first year of presenting doing short
talks at the JUG, maybe work my way up to a longer talk by the end of the year, or maybe
the following year, then the year after that to submit to conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, with amazing mentors like mine, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Martin Thompson was
due to
give a talk at JavaOne at the end of that year (still 2011), and I was lucky
enough to get a ticket at the last minute (we won the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.net/dukeschoice/2011&#34;&gt;Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award
for Innovative Programming Framework&lt;/a&gt;,
and LMAX was awesome enough to let me have the ticket to the
conference to receive the award, since the evangelism efforts and blogging
had had a direct influence on us winning this award). Martin
asked if I wanted to co-present with him. Of course this was terrifying! I
hadn&amp;rsquo;t even done a full length talk at the LJC, I had barely even been to a
conference, let alone presented at the largest Java conference In The World!
So I said yes. These opportunities do not come up every week. It&amp;rsquo;s a talk
Martin had given various times before, he would be there to pick up the slack
if I freaked out, and I knew this material, I&amp;rsquo;d been blogging about it and
answering questions for the last 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really was as terrifying as I thought.  But.  It went well. I answered
difficult questions. We got great feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/post/javaone_2011_roundup/&#34;&gt;JavaOne 2011&lt;/a&gt;
was an important milestone in my evangelism career.  Not only
did I get to put this presentation on my CV, I got to meet a lot of people in
this network: Martin introduced me to a lot of high performance specialists;
Martijn and Ben introduced me to people involved in the JCP, to other Java
User Group leaders, and we somehow got in to the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly party -
I finally got to meet a book publisher and get one step closer to my dream
of writing a book. I also met the ladies behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt;,
and they introduced me to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Stephan007&#34;&gt;Stephan&lt;/a&gt; who runs Devoxx. This turned out
to be an important step in turning an idea I had for a panel into a Devoxx
reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is October.  By the end of the year I had also presented at &lt;a href=&#34;/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/&#34;&gt;JAX London
with Mike&lt;/a&gt;, and at
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/why_we_shouldnt_target_women/&#34;&gt;Devoxx Belgium on a panel&lt;/a&gt;,
largely thanks to the contacts I
had made and the prestige of having a JavaOne talk under my belt.  So I went
from basically zero at the start of that year (my blog had been dormant for
years and I had no experience presenting) to having a blog with thousands of
hits a month and being an &amp;ldquo;international conference speaker&amp;rdquo;. In many ways I
got lucky, because the Disruptor was a really interesting, technical topic
that is in an area developers feel they should understand (high performance).
But I believe it was more a) determination to make this work, even if it
meant using my own time to write blogs and prepare presentations and b)
fantastic mentors who pushed me to do it and opened up their networks to me,
that facilitated this rapid rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, after that things were a lot easier - I had the experience
presenting at conferences, I had Martin and Martijn suggesting conferences to
me (and introducing me to the right people where appropriate), which got me
into the QCon/GOTO loop and into OSCON. With videos of my presentations
availble, combined with the reach of my blog, I also had people approaching
me to do other events, like user groups in the cities I was visiting, and
conferences I had never heard of.  I think it helped that I&amp;rsquo;m a woman,
because conferences are always actively looking to increase their diversity
(whatever it might seem like at times!), but I think that anyone could follow
these sorts of steps with a similar outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk much about my career after that, because really that&amp;rsquo;s
the tipping point - after that it was more of the same, really. I will say
that I left LMAX because the pressure to be a full time developer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; do
advocacy is hard, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re no longer single and you don&amp;rsquo;t have
the spare time you used to have. I joined
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; because they were well known for
understanding the technical community, and because they were looking for an
evangelist who would continue to be an engineer (although not for 40 hours a
week every week). I think they might have hired me without the previous
experience, but the blogging and presenting experience was a big selling
point for the guy who became my boss.  I eventually left
them for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; because you learn, over
time, what your sweet spots are as an advocate/educator, and what your
interests are. After two years of MongoDB, I knew I really wanted to focus
on Java and the JVM, and JetBrains is a much better fit for that. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty
certain I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have got this job without a) having the
conference-presenting experience and therefore b) being known to the team
already through the conference circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. That was a massive post. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off
writing this for ages. That&amp;rsquo;s just my own story, I have another post in my
head about the challenges that face you on trying to sell the value of
evangelism/advocacy to your organisation (and maybe some suggestions). But
that&amp;rsquo;s for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I shall try to leave you with take-away points that I hope will
be helpful if you either want to become a technical advocate, or are interested
in just some aspects, like writing or presenting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a user group.  I cannot, &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; stress how important the LJC was to
my career. If you do nothing else, this is the one thing that can help you.
You will meet people who will inspire you or give you the kick up the
backside you need. Try to remember that many of these people, like me, were
developers like you before they became bloggers/authors/speakers. If they
can, you can. These people also have networks, and whether you like it or
not, it really is not what you know but who you know (but don&amp;rsquo;t let that put
you off - meeting the right people can be easier than becoming some sort of
super-expert!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present at the user group. Preferably get them to video it - you can use
this in submissions to conferences, if it&amp;rsquo;s not a blind CFP they will like to
see examples of your style. Having an example, even one that you think isn&amp;rsquo;t
awesome, is much, much better than having nothing at all. (Also, and this is
not a blog post about becoming a better speaker, but do watch your own
videos - it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;insanely&lt;/em&gt; painful the first few times, but it gets easier and
will help you to improve).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to commit your own time to this. I blogged and prepared talks
at weekends, even for companies that valued evangelism. I gave up evenings
to attend the user group.  This will be
especially important in the early days when you probably have a day job too.
This investment should pay off, either your company will learn to see the
value of it and give you more time (having developers attend and speak at the
LJC was enormously successful for recruitment for LMAX), or you will get a
job better suited to what you want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have something awesome to talk about. I got lucky with
the Disruptor, true. But our most in-demand topics at the Sevilla Java User
Group are &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; topics, especially for things that are
no-longer cutting edge - not all developers were early adopters, and now they
need an overview of &amp;ldquo;why NoSQL&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s Docker&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be awesome. Your blog doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect English
(especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not a native). It just needs to clearly describe the
thing you&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain. You don&amp;rsquo;t
have to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/author/Damian-Conway&#34;&gt;Damian Conway&lt;/a&gt;(one of
my favourite presenters) when you speak - in my experience, a presenter
can get away with either &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; great content or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; great delivery, you
actually don&amp;rsquo;t need both. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to conferences where presenters haven&amp;rsquo;t
really had either - you have to start somewhere, and audiences are
surprisingly forgiving (especially at user groups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find mentors. Listen to them. You might not even meet them, you can watch
what they do. But I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to find real human beings who are a step
or two closer to where you want to be. Talk to them, let them know what you
want. And let them bully you into doing scary things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be yourself. Figure out your strengths and interests, and play to them. I
was scared of being a woman developer on show, via the blog or via
conferences, but it turns out to be an advantage. I was afraid that because
I&amp;rsquo;m not Martin Thompson I can&amp;rsquo;t possibly talk about difficult technical
subjects. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be him, I can be me - I can explain things to
the level that I need to understand them, so other developers like me can
catch up with me. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to all be genius-level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do things that scare you. The terrifying things are the things that got me
the furthest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Evangelism / Technical Advocacy - I use these terms fairly
interchangeably. Evangelism was the common name some years back, but many
are uncomfortable with the religious overtones, so instead prefer Advocacy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This is why I often talk about being at ThoughtWorks for a
minute and a half - I really loved a lot of things about the company, but what
I really wanted to do was offered to me in a company I already knew, where I
could get going straight away without any ramp up&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6771.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
calm before the storm&#34; title=&#34;The calm before the storm&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the more I go to conferences, the less I write about them.  I could claim lack of time, but
the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Loved &amp;lt;city&amp;gt;, went to talks that made me
think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if people get bored of reading
that, but I get bored of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6803.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34; title=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I&amp;rsquo;m bored of conferences. On the contrary - since I work from home, travelling to new places and
meeting Real Human Beings keeps me sane. Plus conferences are fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6753.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
setup&#34; title=&#34;The setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I went to a conference on Saturday that makes me feel compelled to write something, and not just because it was
organised by my two fellow &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla JUG&lt;/a&gt; organisers.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt; are both doing more Android day-to-day than
server-side Java, so this is an area they&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about. Not content with organising
Android events every other month, they decided they had so many interesting speakers they wanted to have speaking here
in Sevilla that they wanted to run a whole day, single track conference, on behalf of &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/communities/114997118727600981533&#34;&gt;GDG Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidxtended.com/&#34;&gt;Android Xtended&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6848.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Android Xtended&#34; title=&#34;Android Xtended&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;As a Java &amp;ldquo;Technical Advocate&amp;rdquo;, I suppose I should keep an eye on what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the Android space, it&amp;rsquo;s quite a
huge part of the ecosystem&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/post/androidxtended#footnote1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go in any sort
of official capacity (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t speaking, manning a booth, organising or sponsoring), so I could just enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/registration.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hola...&#34; title=&#34;Hola...&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they roped me into doing registrations. Me! I was concerned my Spanish wasn&amp;rsquo;t up for it, but apparently I only
needed two words: &amp;ldquo;nombre&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;talla&amp;rdquo; (for the t-shirt). Oh, and &amp;ldquo;treinta y uno b&amp;rdquo; - there was such demand for the
conference the initial venue wasn&amp;rsquo;t big enough, so it was being hosted at two sites on the same road. Not
surprisingly, some turned up to the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6813.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@inmaculadaalcon&#34; title=&#34;@inmaculadaalcon&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a large number of our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; events, all the talks were in Spanish. So feel
free to ignore my analysis if you like - my Spanish comprehension is pretty good, but sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t realise when
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand something and just make up my own story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float:left; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6794.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
alt=&#34;@flipper83&#34; title=&#34;@flipper83&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far in the Android space is Getting Started type material - a lot of tutorials and
examples that show you how to achieve a particular goal. There seems to be less of an emphasis on areas that
interest me as an experienced Java person - easy automation of testing, good design practices, craftsmanship etc. Now,
 it may be that because those areas (apart from testing) apply to both back-end Java and Android, there&amp;rsquo;s less of a
 need to re-iterate it in the Android space. Or it may be that I don&amp;rsquo;t see the entry-level Java stuff any more,
 because I don&amp;rsquo;t need it, and I seek out the topics that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6892.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
 alt=&#34;@JMPergar&#34; title=&#34;@JMPergar&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or it may be that as Android is one of those
 platforms that&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start as a fairly novice developer (because you can write self-contained code with
 a visible UI and get results fairly easily), lots of the focus is on the needs of new developers.  Whatever the
 reason, I had been starting to feel like the Android ecosystem was missing people taking developers beyond that
 initial step of getting something to work and up to the level of creating maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6880.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@pedro_g_s&#34; title=&#34;@pedro_g_s&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Xtended put my mind at rest. Here was a range of talks that led attendees through the things that will make
them more effective developers - tools and libraries to use; testing approaches; integration with persistence; clean
(code) design for the UI; design patterns and domain driven design to simplify your code, and so on. As an employee
of JetBrains, I was obviously very happy to see both
&lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html&#34;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; mentioned and used throughout as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6863.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@davilagrau&#34; title=&#34;@davilagrau&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as fantastic speakers (they knew their stuff, were clearly practitioners, and all had great individual
presentation styles), there were three mob-programming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6853.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mob Programming&#34; title=&#34;Mob Programming&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an ambitious attempt to not just preach to
a passive audience, but to involve them in creating real, working code to teach fundamental practices - dependency
injection, testing and Gradle.  An hour is barely enough time to give a practiced demo of real code, to create
something collaboratively with an audience of 30 people was a challenge. But I thought it did give people a flavour
of not just how to use the technologies, but what they were for. I also saw a lot of the audience starting to
realise the power of refactoring using an IDE - I firmly believe the best way to teach the power of a tool is by
pair programming or, at least, using the tool in real use cases in front of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6921.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;More collaboration&#34; title=&#34;More collaboration&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mob programming was kinda
like a half day tutorial squished into an hour. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to hear how the attendees found it. For me, since
this was a full day conference that cost &amp;euro;10, I thought getting three short tutorials as well as five excellent
talks was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6896.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Happy developers&#34; title=&#34;Happy developers&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6883.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
alt=&#34;Interesting...&#34; title=&#34;Interesting...&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss in talking about the conference if I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the venue.  We were at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://espaciores.org/&#34;&gt;Espacio RES&lt;/a&gt;, which was pretty easy to get to, and a really nice, airy, comfortable
space&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/post/androidxtended#footnote2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
And they let us rearrange their whole place just for us. The only downside is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold more people, which
is a shame, and the reason we had to host on two sites (I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on the other site as I stayed
at RES the whole day, but we&amp;rsquo;re very grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitnami.com/&#34;&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt; for lending us their offices as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6831.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Collaboration&#34; title=&#34;Collaboration&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what did I learn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://espaciores.org/&#34;&gt;Espacio RES&lt;/a&gt; is a really nice space that hopefully we can use more regularly for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to use Good Practices to write Android code, and Real Developers are doing so for Real Applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are very talented and expert technical speakers in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to two conferences in Spain in
the last month, but as they were all in English I think it puts some people off presenting. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see Spanish
talent being showcased, it gives developers here good role models and shows that experts aren&amp;rsquo;t just from outside
Spain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevilla has a very healthy tech scene with people more than happy to give up a Saturday to learn new things. In
fact, for some set of people, they prefer Saturdays to weekday
evenings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/post/androidxtended#footnote3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m about to lose more weekends in the
future&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6872.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;People like Saturdays?&#34; title=&#34;People like 
 Saturdays?&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Xtended was a fantastic event, with great speakers and engaged attendees.  I loved how social
 everyone was during the breaks, how people were happy to chat and share stories, even though most of the attendees
 didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other beforehand. It was brilliantly organised, and although I did see how much work went into
 arranging it, you would never believe from how smoothly it went that this two-venue event was organised by just two
 guys. Well done &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6927.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Drinks&#34; title=&#34;Drinks&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Although in my experience Android and &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; Java user groups and events tend not to
 overlap much - not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a function of the relationship between Google and Oracle or just because large cities like
 London tend to split groups along technology lines to keep group and event sizes manageable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The downside was there are not a lot of places nearby open for coffee at 8am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This is completely alien to me as someone who built her career largely in London - you
 do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; host events on a Saturday, except for maybe the annual LJC Open Conference, because many people have a
 long commute into the city. Doing that 5 days a week is plenty, most people don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it on a Saturday as
 well. But they will give up a couple of hours in the evening, as it costs far less in time overall.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blind CFPs - a Postscript</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since publishing &lt;a href=&#34;/post/blind_cfps&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great comments, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write yet
another post to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me state that I don&amp;rsquo;t think blind CFPs are a complete waste of time - for example, I know that there are
circles in which speakers will refuse to submit if the selection process isn&amp;rsquo;t blind. But what blind CFPs are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;,
is an answer to &amp;ldquo;How do I get more women speakers at my conference?&amp;rdquo;, especially if the problem is not that the
women are being rejected, but that they simply aren&amp;rsquo;t submitting talks - this is the situation I see most frequently
in the conferences I speak at/help organise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re missing the point of blind CFPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to address the point &amp;ldquo;Blind CFPs are to protect the organisers, not simply to improve diversity&amp;rdquo;. OK, great. So
in the case of the conferences that had only two women out of 200 submissions: if you make that process blind, whether you
select both women or not, when there are nasty comments about your lack of women speakers, you&amp;rsquo;re protected - you did
the right things, you had a blind CFP, and just not many women made it through that process. Women simply aren&amp;rsquo;t
writing compelling abstracts and/or aren&amp;rsquo;t picking interesting subjects and/or clearly aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in
presenting at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAAARRRGGHHHHHH!!!! Anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protect your arse if you like, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, I see the attacks against organisers and I understand the need to be able to
say you did the right thing. But notice that once you&amp;rsquo;ve protected yourselves, the blame is back on the
minorities for not meeting your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a blind CFP is to protect the selectors, then let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend it&amp;rsquo;s an answer to increasing diversity
of speakers, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece in a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;An abstract is not a representation of your talk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can emphasise this enough: blind CFPs have a very big weakness - there is no direct correlation between
a good abstract and a good talk. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a bunch of talks online lately, and I watched one with an abstract
that absolutely called to me - here was the missing piece for a technology that I simply can&amp;rsquo;t get my head around. I
gave an hour of my life to that talk, each minute I was wondering when this person would get to the bits mentioned
in the abstract, so I watched it all the way to the end. They never delivered what the abstract promised, and their
meandering style meant I learnt almost nothing from the talk. That&amp;rsquo;s an hour of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back. Good
thing I was playing computer games as well at the time, if I&amp;rsquo;d paid money for that I would have been very peeved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another weakness in this process - if you go to a number of conferences (like I do) you kinda learn which
speakers are doing
which talks.  If I submit my &amp;ldquo;AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong??&amp;rdquo;
talk to a blind process, if there&amp;rsquo;s anyone on the selection committee who&amp;rsquo;s even vaguely involved in the Java or MongoDB
spaces, they&amp;rsquo;ll know that&amp;rsquo;s me. And they can Google the talk and decide whether they like it (or with any luck, the
buzz-word crammed title will do the job and they&amp;rsquo;ll say yes, although probably AngularJS is so 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abstract is like your presentation in the same way that your CV is like your ability to do your job - there&amp;rsquo;s a skill
to writing good abstracts (or CVs), but mastery of that skill does not necessarily mean mastery of the thing it
represents - the ability to present or the ability to do the job.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be sold on a blind process
being a good way to build &amp;ldquo;the best content available for the conference&amp;rdquo; until this disconnect is somehow solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;For goodness sake Trisha, the postscript is nearly longer than the original post&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to feedback from a bunch of people, and I have learnt more things (thanks everyone!). I am more sold on
a blind CFP being maybe part of a bigger process. But I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe it fixes the &amp;ldquo;we need more women speakers&amp;rdquo;
problem, which was the original claim that I wanted to dispute. Conferences have to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more active to address
this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am not sold on an abstract being a fair representation of the quality of a talk. Maybe a more realistic &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo;
audition would be to give the talk to an audience, like a user group, who rated the talk:
the organisers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t watch the talk, but they could use the ratings to decide. Yes, the user group could also
have biases that affect their rating, but when the speaker gives the talk at the conference, those attendees will also
have their biases too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blindness is not a realistic option, we just have to keep putting women (and other non-white-straight-men) in front of
audiences until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Blind CFPs Really The Answer?</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Off the back of &lt;a href=&#34;/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I received a number of comments and questions
around blind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/&#34;&gt;CFPs&lt;/a&gt; (Call For Papers - usually to get into a conference you submit to a CFP) for
conferences. I often hear it said that a blind CFP will fix, or at least improve, the diversity imbalance at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I should caveat this with: this is going to be a blog post based on my experiences and chats with people, and I
have zero science to back this up. Sorry. But I do have some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of London conferences that I won&amp;rsquo;t name (because I haven&amp;rsquo;t asked their permission not because they&amp;rsquo;ve
done anything wrong) that in some years have received only 2 from around 200 (or more) submissions from women. These
conferences have accepted 100% of the submissions from women, and then been open to criticism for not having enough women
speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blind CFP to remove unconscious bias from the selection committee might have resulted in zero women speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know the next argument is that advertising a blind CFP might encourage a wider diversity of speakers to apply. This
does seem to work in some parts of the industry (I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to women from tech scenes that don&amp;rsquo;t intersect with mine
and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see that we have different problems in different segments of the wider development world). But for my
world, which is largely Java, with some forays into Agile, NoSQL, Open Source, and Enterprise, the women I speak to
aren&amp;rsquo;t scared they&amp;rsquo;ll be discriminated against if they put their name on a CFP. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to
lose by submitting and being rejected. They&amp;rsquo;re more afraid they&amp;rsquo;ll be accepted, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll have to give a
presentation! No, the women I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to in my world don&amp;rsquo;t submit because they don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready, they don&amp;rsquo;t think they
have anything to talk about, and they&amp;rsquo;re worried about the sorts of questions they&amp;rsquo;ll get asked when they&amp;rsquo;re standing up
there. Those fears aren&amp;rsquo;t allayed by having a blind CFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any fears of being judged as a woman, it&amp;rsquo;s when we&amp;rsquo;re standing up in front of people at the conference, and
no amount of blindness during the CFP process is going to make us feel better about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, I find the idea of a blind CFP terrifying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, if you have such a problem with judging people based on race or gender that you have to anonymise the
selection process, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to speak at your conference where my gender will be blatantly on show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, when I was starting out as a speaker, I was new to writing titles and abstracts and expected that they would
not be good enough to get in. With a blind CFP I would never find out why as I could never ask for feedback on my
anonymous abstract. As a novice speaker, I expected my gender would help me be selected, not hinder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, as an experienced speaker I know my abstract-writing has not really improved, but I know my presenting has,
and I know there are videos of me out there doing a good job as a presenter, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is my audition tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was starting out as a speaker, I knew there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough women presenters around. And although I hate the idea
of positive discrimination and hate the idea that men might think I got into my position merely because I&amp;rsquo;m female, I knew
that being a woman made me stand out in all those submissions. And I knew that enough conferences would take a chance on
me, if only to improve their diversity, and that&amp;rsquo;s all I needed to bootstrap my speaking career - once I had spoken at
enough conferences, once I had videos of me doing that, I would find it much easier to get into the next conferences.
And that&amp;rsquo;s worked. And now, as an experienced (female) speaker, I fear blind CFPs as they won&amp;rsquo;t know who I am or what I&amp;rsquo;m
capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my opinion as a female speaker. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to be on the programme committee for a couple
of conferences, and after three years or so of speaking at conferences I know a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of conference organisers.  Let&amp;rsquo;s
assume you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;merely&amp;rdquo; trying to build the best conference you can around your subject whilst not discriminating against
anyone (i.e. let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;re not going out of your way to actively promote diversity). How can you do this when you only
have abstracts and titles to go on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nber.org/papers/w5903&#34;&gt;studies around blind auditions for orchestras&lt;/a&gt;. And I understand
how tempting it is to try to apply that to our world, since it has had an effect on the number of women in orchestras
(but let&amp;rsquo;s not get too excited here, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about an increase from 5% to 25% over thirty years&amp;hellip;). I think
blind auditions would work really well for coding - we can look at just the code, without knowing anything about the
physical body behind the code, and figure out if that person is good enough for us. We could even do blind pair
programming, using screen sharing and chat (actually that&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll patent that!). Because
the thing you&amp;rsquo;ve anonymised (the code) is the output you really care about in a programming job. If you communicate via
chat you can even measure someone&amp;rsquo;s communication skills without judging them physically, another vital skill for
being part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a talk abstract is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the output we&amp;rsquo;re looking for.  Sure, a good title and abstract will attract attendees to the
conference and bums on seats in the actual talk. But the output you&amp;rsquo;re looking for is the presenter - their style, their
approach to the topic, their ability to hold attention, their ability to impart information. We&amp;rsquo;re not always looking
for the same things either, an interesting topic presented nervously but logically is fine, as is an entertaining
presenter reminding us of fundamentals we already know (and any other combination of strengths and weaknesses). An abstract
can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how good the presentation is going to be. Evaluating a presentation on a blind abstract would be like
evaluating those musicians on a couple of paragraphs explaining what they&amp;rsquo;re going to play and how they&amp;rsquo;re going to
try to make you feel when they play it - the words could sound great, but the musician might not even be able to play
the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best audition you can have as a presenter is to, well, present. Videos, audio clips, even screencasts. But the
problem with presenting is that it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking obvious that you&amp;rsquo;re a woman (or other variation on
non-white-straight-male).  If you can&amp;rsquo;t objectively evaluate a presentation without taking away the presenter&amp;rsquo;s
physical body (for colour
or gender or whatever), then you&amp;rsquo;ve got real problems. Your audience is going to be faced with that physical body for an
hour of their life, and you can bet they&amp;rsquo;ll be judging them too.  You want to be damned sure that you&amp;rsquo;ve selected a
competent presenter, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stand by that choice. Saying &amp;ldquo;oh, well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem boring in their
abstract&amp;rdquo; is not going to make the audience feel like you did a good job of the selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another point about non-blind selection processes, other than the process allowing you to select on presentation
ability rather than abstract-writing ability: you can be more active in promoting diversity. I am against &amp;ldquo;affirmative
action&amp;rdquo;, but if the proportion of women submitting presentations is lower than the proportion of women in the field, there&amp;rsquo;s
something missing.  Here are some of the things you can do if you identify a lack of a certain demographic - as usual,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rdquo;, but you could equally argue this for any demographic, even not-enough-C#-developers or
too-many-startups-not-enough-enterprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to relevant user groups and communities asking them to submit.  In London for example, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/&#34;&gt;Ladies Who Code&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-london/&#34;&gt;Women Who Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://london.girlgeekdinners.com/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Dinners&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/&#34;&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-London/&#34;&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data/&#34;&gt;Women in Data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekgirlmeetup.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/WIGJMeetup/&#34;&gt;Women in Games Jobs&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://girlsintechuk.com/community/&#34;&gt;Girls in Tech&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Geek-Girls-Unite-London/&#34;&gt;Girl Geeks Unite&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://witi.meetup.com/cities/gb/17/london/&#34;&gt;whole host of women techies meetups&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; And don&amp;rsquo;t think I psychically
know about all those
because I have two X chromosomes, I found half of those just now, in less than two minutes, by Googling
&amp;ldquo;Girl Geeks London&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women Tech London&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the faces of the women you do want to have speak (or the women on your programme committee, or both) on your
website - showing these women sends the message that this conference is for women. It should also impact the diversity
of your attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to specific women speakers and ask them to present. &lt;a href=&#34;/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about this before&lt;/a&gt;,
women speakers are few and far between, and a) they get
booked in advance and b) are busy enough not to have to (or want to) submit via a CFP process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;more ideas here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more - you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to drain the pool dry of known competent speakers-who-tick-some-diversity-box. With
a non-blind process you can actively improve the submissions you do have, assuming you&amp;rsquo;re not one of the conferences
suffering from a complete lack of submissions from those people. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to increase the number of women
presenting at your conference, if you have women submitting but they don&amp;rsquo;t quite meet your criteria (maybe the abstract
is weak, the title isn&amp;rsquo;t catchy, or maybe the presenter simply isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet) you, as the conference organiser, are
in the perfect position to mentor these people: you can help them re-write their abstracts; you can offer them mentoring
and training for presenting. If there&amp;rsquo;s no record of them presenting but you&amp;rsquo;re interested in evaluating their ability,
you can set them up with a user group to present at - as a conference organiser, you have the network contacts that
new speakers might not. You can run sessions aimed at people who have never done public speaking (I&amp;rsquo;ve run a session
like this four times now, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; and at Ladies Who Code -
I had &lt;em&gt;over 70&lt;/em&gt; RSVPs for the last London Ladies Who Code session, twice the number of the last LJC session,
so there are plenty of women interested in breaking into this field, who are looking for training, who don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready
to present yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are my points?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blind process of selection can be applied to something where the output you&amp;rsquo;re selecting for can be effectively
anonymised: music auditions, code, technical writing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blind process where you select based on criteria that are not the end result will only be effective
if it&amp;rsquo;s the selection process is biased, or if submissions to the selection process are lower
from discriminated-against-groups because they fear a biased selection process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those conferences that are getting very tiny numbers of submissions from women (I&amp;rsquo;m picking women as the example
but you can pick any group you want), a blind process could lead to even fewer selected women speakers. Instead of
switching to a blind process, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to want to check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the messaging around your conference (remember masculine words like rock star, ninja, competitive, hardcore,
challenging etc &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/31438/&#34;&gt;put women off applying to jobs&lt;/a&gt;, the same probably applies to technical conferences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subliminal messages on your website/info (one of the conferences I mentioned, for example, sent out a couple of emails
containing photos of previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences which happened to only show men - this was not even representative of
the conference, but it can have an unexpectedly big effect on the subconscious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have you showcased the diversity of the conference, or previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences, with photos, interviews, testamonials?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A non-blind submission process allows you to be more active in promoting diversity - instead of hoping that the
submissions are representative of the diversity in your community, and that selecting the most interesting talks
will naturally lead to improved diversity, with a non-blind process you can track exactly how many women are submitting,
address problems in this area early and offer mentoring to those who aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet. Remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified/0-qualified/&#34;&gt;women
only apply for jobs they feel 100% qualified for&lt;/a&gt;
and take fewer chances, they might need that extra push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that implementing a blind CFP will address the lack of diversity in conference speakers. I
know it helps in some circles, but I personally think that conference selection committees should a) be much better at
identifying their own biases and actively attempting to overcome them b) be active in improving the diversity of
their conference, and c) be offering feedback and mentoring to those who are not quite ready yet in order to improve
the overall ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity isn&amp;rsquo;t going to accidentally happen when we stop looking at gender and race and other visible you-don&amp;rsquo;t-belong-here
cues.  Diversity is only going to happen if people fight for it, and if we actively train, mentor, and support those
trying to break through the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;/post/blind_cfps_2&#34;&gt;follow up&lt;/a&gt; based off responses to this post, covering additional questions raised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m so tired of it all</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We work so hard to promote equality, to fight for the rights of people who are not middle-class
white men, and time and again it just feels like we&amp;rsquo;re not getting anywhere.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internationalwomensday.com/&#34;&gt;International Women&amp;rsquo;s
Day&lt;/a&gt; highlights the issues that face women all around the world, and make our
women-in-tech problem
look like a genuine &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstworldproblems&#34;&gt;First World Problem&lt;/a&gt;, and yet we can&amp;rsquo;t even get that right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave up. This weekend I thought, fuck it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done my bit. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the phase in my
career where being a woman was a disadvantage and somehow arrived out the other side - in my position, in my job, it&amp;rsquo;s
an advantage, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to change anything to improve things for my career. I&amp;rsquo;m going to carry on doing my job to the best
of my ability, but I&amp;rsquo;m no longer going to let this diversity thing drain my energy - nothing ever seems to make a difference anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, four (white, middle-class, English-speaking) men who I know well, who
I have seen by their actions are champions of women in technology, who have personally mentored
me in some way or another, have been accused of not thinking about women techies, not encouraging them - have
been accused of sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This third year of being on the programme committee for QCon, I could see we had achieved far more to promote diversity
than ever before, but it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much work to get that far, and there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another conference I have great affection for which has never previously suffered badly from a lack of women speakers
received practically
zero submissions for full conference talks from women this year. The submissions that did come in were from the usual
suspects, the speakers who one calls upon when desperately trying to shore up the gender diversity of your speaker line-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sevilla Java User Group, which I started, with my money, which I present at regularly, has had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; female
developers attend who were not previously friends. Apparently the impact of visible female role models is far smaller than
I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so much work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s thankless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the men who support the women, they get attacked by both sides - by women, for not
doing enough, or sometimes for simply being privileged white men, by men and women for fighting for something that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact them, and by men for betraying their gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the women, it&amp;rsquo;s the same but more so: some women accuse us of not doing enough, some women sneer at what we&amp;rsquo;re doing,
telling us we already have equality, men and women think you&amp;rsquo;re in it just to improve your own life, and the men, well,
many men genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t understand the problems (and it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting to explain), and some are outright hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to find men allies.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone else, but at this stage in my career I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by men
who are all allies. And I can honestly say that any professional struggles I&amp;rsquo;ve had in recent years I can see are suffered
by my colleagues of the opposite sex, so I know they&amp;rsquo;re not because of my gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s only fair that our male allies suffer the same way we do, even though they get even less out of fighting our battles
than we do. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s fair that they are attacked by both genders, and have to put up with unfair, unjust
criticism and accusations. After all, look at some of the vile, hate-filled messages thrown at women leading the charge -
that&amp;rsquo;s abuse. Some of these women fear for their lives.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live that life, and I despair that we live in a
society that can&amp;rsquo;t seem to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m a bit burnt out. So my friends are finding it tough. But this is a marathon, not a sprint.  And I never did this
for me anyway. I care about diversity because it matters. I try to change the gender balance specifically, because that&amp;rsquo;s an area I
might be able to impact, one I have a chance of understanding. I care about equality, about justice, because
it matters. And I do my tiny part to try and drown out the hate, the anger, the &amp;ldquo;get back into the kitchen, woman&amp;rdquo;
because those things make me feel sick, because &amp;ldquo;you can be whoever you want to be&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a lie, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come
with caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or energy for large-scale revolutions, but I will carry on trying to make a small difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By trying to be a role model for anyone who can relate to me, whatever their colour, gender, or sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By being visible as a woman techie, who does woman techie things, who&amp;rsquo;s also a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By calling out (quietly and personally, at least at first) where I see things that might give the wrong message: e.g.
e-mailing conference organisers to point out they only have white men in their line up; private messaging people to
let them know their comments could be taken the wrong way; pointing out to user group leaders that their meetup
page shows only men at their events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By continuing to give an honest view of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a female Java developer, especially if these
experiences are different to those of other women - one woman&amp;rsquo;s view does not represent every woman&amp;rsquo;s view, if more
of us tell our different tales, we have a better view of the whole ecosystem (and its inhabitants).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By sharing not only the negatives, but the many positives of working in such a varied and rapidly changing profession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of fighting, however tiny my efforts are. But I&amp;rsquo;m more tired of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
